// This is the help file for Bol Processor BP2 and BP3.
// When editing it, beware that BP3 looks for prefixes. Therefore, if an item is
// the prefix of another one then it should precede it in this file.
### Help 
• To access on-line help, type cmd-? or select "Help" in the "Action" menu.
The cursor becomes a question mark.  Select a menu command, click a button or
select any word or group of words you need information about.
• In the "Help" text, expressions between quotes are hyperlinks to more entries.
### What style of music is BP2/BP3 dealing with?
• BP2/BP3 is not designed for a particular musical style. It stemmed out of formalizing
    music representation and composition tasks in the context of non-western music, notably
    North-Indian rhythm. For this reason it focused on text-oriented representations and formal
    grammmars.  'Bol Processor' originates from the word 'bol' (Hindi/Urdu 'bolna', to speak)
    designating the onomatopeic names of drum strokes in India.
• When MIDI output was designed, elementary musical 'gestures' that produced sounds on drums
    were replaced with "sound-objects", i.e. arbitrary sequences of events encoded as MIDI messages.
• Simplified sound-objects named "simple notes" have later been introduced to facilitate work
    with western tonal systems in English, French or Indian "note conventions".
• BP2/BP3 is now able to deal with polyphony, and does it in a smart way. See "polymetric structures".
• BP2/BP3 also deals with incomplete representations of polyrhythmic sequences.
    See "period notation".
• BP2/BP3 is able to control all MIDI parameters, including continuous parameters such as pitchbend,
    polyphonic pressure, panoramic, etc.  See "performance controls".
• BP2/BP3 has interactive features used in the "improvize mode".  It responds to MIDI messages
    (see "Interactive mode") and to "Apple Events".
• Thanks to Csound, BP2/BP3 bypasses limitations of MIDI, and takes advantage of both environments.
    (See "Csound implementation")
### How does the output of BP2/BP3 look like?
• There are three representation levels:
1) The symbolic level, at which music is represented as a TEXT score. This score uses either
    "simple notes" or "sound-objects" completed with "performance controls".
    Polyphonic items use "polymetric expressions".
    Sequences may use the "period notation".
2) The graphic level, at which "simple notes" or "sound-objects" are shown with their actual
    physical timings.
3) The sound level, a flow of MIDI messages sent in real time to a MIDI device, a MIDI
    file or a Csound score.
• Output options are set in the "Settings" window.  If "Display items" is checked then
    musical items are first displayed as text scores.  This is not recommended for long items.
    If "Show graphics" is checked then graphic scores are displayed while items are played on the
    MIDI output.  If none is checked then items are played directly, but for each item the option
    is given to display the text score.
• A text score may be displayed in graphic and played on the MIDI output: select the text and do
    "Play selection" in the "Action" menu.
### How does the input of BP2/BP3 look like?
• A score in text format may be selected and played on the MIDI output: select "Play selection"
    in the "Action" menu.  Try it for example on "C5 C5 C5 D5 E5_ D5_ C5 E5 D5 D5 C5_ _ _".
• Examples of (less trivial) text format scores are stored in '-da' files that may be loaded to
    the "Data" window.  There are more examples in the enclosed data-base "TryAppleEvents.fm"
    which may be opened under Claris FileMaker Pro.
• A grammar is the formal description of a process producing musical text scores which BP2/BP3 is able
    to play on its MIDI output.  Load for instance '-gr.Mozart' in the "Grammar" window, then
    type command-R or select "Produce items" in the "Action" window.
• A script is a sequence of meta-instructions performing all operations automatically in BP2.
    Scripts are discussed in the initial part ("QuickStart") of the enclosed MS-Word document
    "BP2 doc - MS Word".
• MIDI files type 0, 1 or 2 can be imported to create "sound-object prototypes".
• Csound scores can be imported to create "sound-object prototypes".
• BP2 responds to input MIDI messages.  See "Interactive mode".
• BP2 works in a client-server environment. It responds to "Apple Events" that may launch all
    kinds of processes.  The data-base "TryAppleEvents.fm" is a good illustration of this.
### Interactive mode
In this mode, BP2 is able to respond in real time to MIDI messages that are assigned certain tasks.
Assignments are listed as script instructions in the "Interaction" window.
    (Open '-in.abc1' to see an example)
• For instance, instruction
        IN Param K1 = controller #7 channel 16
    assigns controller #7 on channel 16 to fix the value of parameter K1.
    This parameter may control weights in grammar rules, velocities, etc. (see "Variable arguments")
• Related topic: "Apple Events"
Contains most commands of BP2. You may document them with the on-line "Help".
### Variables
BP2/BP3 recognizes strings starting with an uppercase character as "variables" in grammars
    or in its glossary. It creates a variable if it is not already there, so be careful
    with spelling mistakes.
• You may however start a variable with a lower-case character provided that you write
    it between |vertical bars|.
• Variable names may be of any length and may contain any character (standard or
    extended), digit, or punctuation symbol in the set: \ - _ # @ % $ " % '
• Examples of well-formed variables:
      MyNewTrick  Good_enough  |behind_the_bars|  X67$-J  Big@mac  The"new"thing
      It's_there    De_Noël_à_Pâques
      Peter-Piper-pick'd-a-pick-of-pickl'd-pepper
• Related topic: "Terminal alphabet"
### Polymetric structures
A structure of "sound-objects" represented as a "polymetric expression".
### Polymetric expressions
• An expression denoting a polyphonic or/and polyrhythmic structure of "sound-objects".
    Example:
    {C4 D4 E4,G3 E3} (brackets optional) means that "C4 D4 E4" will be played in the same
    time as "G3 E3".
• BP2/BP3 manages to adjust durations.  Here, the duration of each beat is determined by the
    first beat "C4 D4 E4", hence three beats. It will be interpreted:
      /2 {C4_ D4_ E4_,G3_ _ E3 _ _}
    yielding the phase diagram:
        C4 _  D4 _  E4 _
        G3 _  _  E3 _  _
• BP2/BP3 uses the same algorithm to deal with polymetric expressions and with "period notation".
• A polymetric expression can contain another polymetric expression, including expressions in
    "period notation".
    Try to play: {C4 D4 E4,{G3,C3} E3} for instance [with "English convention" checked
        in the 'Misc' menu].
• Many commented examples will be found in "-da.checkPoly".
### Undetermined rests
• These are notated '_rest'.
    The old notation '…' (be careful: this is a single character, not three periods!)
    is still valid, but it is not recommended because of character conversion in HTML docs.
• Undetermined rests are used in fields of "polymetric expressions" or in beats of the
	"period notation". The interpreter determines their durations as the ones yielding
	the simplest expanded expression.
• For instance, the sequence
       a b c d • e _rest f • g h _rest i     (also notated    a b c d • e … f • g h … i)
    will be expanded as:
       a b c d • e - _ f • g h - i
• Similarly, the polymetric expression
       {3/2 c d e, _rest f g}       (also notated     {3/2 c d e, … f g})
    will be expanded as:
        /2 {- _ _ c _ d _ e _,- _ _ _ _ f _ g _}
• Each field of a polymetric expression (or each beat of a sequence) may contain
   several undetermined rest.  (This is a recent feature). In this case, these rests
   share equal durations.  For instance,
       {C3 D3 B2, _rest C4 D4 _rest B3}
   is expanded as:
       /8 {C3_ _ _ _ _ _ _ D3_ _ _ _ _ _ _ B2_ _ _ _ _ _ _,
                                     -_ _ C4_ _ _ _ _ D4_ _ _ _ _ -_ _ B3_ _ _ _ _}
   in which each rest has a duration of 3/8 beats.
### Period notation
• Periods are used to indicate 'beats', i.e. sequences of "sound-objects" that are
    constrained to equal symbolic durations. For instance,
        {C4 D4 E4 • G3 E3}    (Brackets {} are optional)
    means that "C4 D4 E4" will be played with the same duration as "G3 E3".
• The duration of each beat is determined by the first beat "C4 D4 E4", hence three
	time units. It will be interpreted:
        /2 C4_ D4_ E4_ • G3_ _ E3_ _
• BP2/BP3 uses the same algorithm to deal with period notation and with "polymetric expressions".
    Thus, {C4 D4 E4,G3 E3}  (the period has been replaced with a comma)
    will be interpreted:
        /2 {C4_ D4_ E4_,G3_ _ E3_ _}
    yielding the phase diagram:
        C4 _  D4 _  E4 _
        G3 _  _  E3 _  _
• Many commented examples will be found in example file '-da.checkPoly'.
### Terminal symbols
See "Terminal alphabet"
### Terminal alphabet
• A 'vocabulary' of arbitrary words (terminal symbols) designating "sound-objects".
• Each word is defined in the 'alphabet' window saved as '-ho.filename'.
• A terminal symbol may also be defined at "compile time" if it appears between
    single quotes in the grammar, or if it is used in an out-time "sound-object":
        <<iAmAnOutTimeSoundObject>>.
• A terminal symbol must start with a lower-case character (a..z) or any symbol in the
    set:
        ÄÅÇÉÑÖÜáàâäãåçéèêëíìîïñóòôöõúùûüÆæøÀÃÕŒœÿßØµ∂∑∏πΩƒ∆¥#
• Other characters in a terminal symbol may be any character (a..z, A..Z) or a
    character in the above set, or characters in additional set:
        0123456789#%@¢£§◊$®©™\'"†°`´¨≠∞±≤≥ªº¿¡√«»“”‘’÷
• The above restrictions do NOT apply to terminal symbols defined between single quotes
    in grammars.
• You may define relations (homomorphisms) in a given alphabet.  See: "homomorphism".
• Terminal symbols are mapped to "sound-object prototypes" thanks to the information
    contained in "-mi.filename".  The name of this file should be inserted on top of the
    'alphabet' window.
• BP2/BP3 also recognizes predefined terminal symbols called "simple notes".
• Related topics: "Variables", "sound-objects".
### Metavariables
See "Wild cards"
### Wild cards
Symbols '?', '?1', '?2', ... '?n' are used as wild cards in grammar rules.  They may
    be instantiated as a single "terminal symbol", "simple note", "variable", bracket,
    "out-time object", "synchronization tag", "time pattern" or "performance control".
• '?' (an old notation) is equivalent to '?1'.
• If the expression contains several wild cards '?n', values are checked for pattern
    matching.  For instance,
        ?1 ?3 ?2 ?2 ?1 ? ?3
    may be instantiated as a pattern "xyzzxty" in which occurrences of x, y and z must be
    identical.
• The same wildcards may be found in the right argument of a rule.  For instance, the
    following rule will reverse the order of two (distinct) symbols:
        ?1 ?2 --> ?2 ?1
### Compile project
Compiles current alphabet, grammar, interactive codes and glossary (if any).
### Compile time
The time when a grammar is being compiled, or some data is being "tokenized". This may
    be opposed to "performance time".
### Tokenized data
Grammars and musical items are represented with reserved words, "terminal symbols"
    and variables. Before using them, BP2/BP3 replaces them with tokens, i.e. numeric
    codes. These codes are not visible to users.
### Performance time
The time when a musical item is being played on the sound output. This may be opposed
    to "compile time".
### Out-time sound-object
• It appears between angle brackets: <<this is an out-time sound-object>>.
• It contains the same sequence of events as an ordinary "sound-object", but its duration
    is forced to zero.  If its label does not appear in the "Terminal alphabet", a new
    terminal symbol will be created at "compile time".
### Null string
A string representing an empty sequence (of "sound-objects").  You may use
    "nil", "lambda", "empty" or "null" (without quotes) to designate a null string.  You
    may also leave the space blank. These are three equivalent notations for the same
    rule:
    S --> nil
    S --> lambda
    S --> empty
    S --> null
    S -->
### Simple notes
These are predefined terminal symbols mapped to predefined "sound-objects"
    containing only a NoteOn / NoteOn pair of MIDI messages.  These "sound-objects"
    are relocatable and have pivots at their beginnings. They can be rescaled at will,
    they can be truncated or covered by neighbouring "sound-objects".  Their "pre-roll" and
    "post-roll" settings are nil.
• The conventional 440Hz tone may be written 'A4', 'la3' or 'dha4', depending on the
    note convention set in the 'Misc' menu, and the one in the "Tuning" dialog.
• See: "English convention", "French convention", "Indian convention","Key numbers".
### MIDI [Devices menu]
This menu item can be toggled.  When checked, items produced by the grammar are played
    using the real-time MIDI output device.
• This setting is also available in the "Input-output settings" window as "Use MIDI in/out".
• May be modified with the script commands "Use MIDI OFF" and "Use MIDI ON"
• Related Topics:  "MIDI format"
### Use MIDI in/out
When checked, items produced by the grammar are played using the real-time MIDI
    output device.
• This setting is also available in the 'Devices' menu as "MIDI".
• May be modified with the script commands "Use MIDI OFF" and "Use MIDI ON"
• Related Topics:  "MIDI format"
### Use MIDI OFF [Script command]
Turns off real-time MIDI output.  See "Use MIDI in/out".
### Use MIDI ON [Script command]
Turns on real-time MIDI output.  See "Use MIDI in/out".
### Tuning dialog
This dialog makes it possible to modify the MIDI keyboard mapping and diapason
    reference used by Csound.
• Usually, key 60 is assigned to C4 (do3 in French, sa4 in Indian), but some MIDI programs,
    notably old versions of BP2/BP3, use alternate note names such as C5 (do4).
• The diapason value has no effect on the MIDI output.  Its is used by Csound for
    instruments requiring a "cps (Hz)" format for pitch.
### Csound
Displays the Csound score attached to this "sound-object prototype".
### Csound tuning
See "Tuning dialog".
### A4 / la3 / dha4 frequency is
See "Tuning dialog".
### MIDI mapping
See "Tuning dialog".
### C4 / do3 / sa4  is MIDI key
See "Tuning dialog".
• A4 is conventionally 440Hz but you may want to change it if your Mac gets too hot :-)
### Relocatable sound-object
A "sound-object" that may be relocated by the "time-setting algorithm".
### Sound objects
See "Sound-objects"
### Sound-objects
See the reference manual and publications.
• In short, a sound-object in BP2/BP3 is a sequence of 'elementary' events, such as MIDI
    or Csound instructions.
• A typical simple sound-object is a "simple note", i.e. a NoteOn/NoteOff
    pair on the same MIDI key and channel.
• Sound-objects are designated by "terminal symbols". Each object is mapped to
    a unique "sound-object prototype" bearing the same name, which defines its metric
    and topologic properties.  (See reference manual).
### Sound-object prototypes
These contain information about "sound-objects" bearing the same name: the list of
elementary events, and metric and topologic properties used by the "time-setting algorithm".
• Elementary events may be MIDI events, Csound events, or both.
### Time-setting algorithm
An algorithm used by BP2/BP3 to calculate the timings of elementary events (e.g.
   MIDI or Csound events) in a musical item. It takes into account the properties of
    "sound-objects" (defined by their "sound-object prototypes") and may relocate or
    truncate objects in order to satisfy all constraints arising therefrom.
### Homomorphism
This is an optional relation on the "terminal alphabet" used by a grammar. It is
    defined over all the terminal symbols and identified by a label. For
    instance, let us call TRANS the one-semitone upward transposition in an alphabet of
    notes. The alphabet file (saved as "-ho.mynotes") would begin like this:
        TRANS
        do0 --> do#0 --> re0 --> re#0  etc... --> si9
• If a "terminal alphabet" uses no homomorphism then arrows "-->" should of course not
    be found.
• You can define several homomorphisms in the same alphabet. Separate them by lines
    of hyphens (just like "subgrammars").
• If an homomorphism has been declared, the last terminal of a line is mapped to
    itself, unless it is defined cyclically. In the example above it would mean that
    si9 --> si9.  But we could as well use a cyclic definition:
        do0 --> do#0 --> re0 --> re#0  etc... --> si9 --> do0
### Derivation mode
See "Subgrammar type" and "Rule derivation mode"
### Subgrammars
A grammar may be "sliced" in several subgrammars that will be applied successively
    to the "work string" for producing derivations.  A new subgrammar is applied only
    once there is no more candidate rule in the current subgrammar. You may however
    bypass this rule by using jumps like _goto() or _failed().
• In analysis (parsing) mode, subgrammars are applied in the reverse order.
### Subgrammar type
The strategy followed by the "inference engine" to produce or analyze an item using
    the rules of this "subgrammar". See: "RND", "ORD", "LIN", "SUB", "SUB1".
### Inference engine
The term is borrowed from expert systems. It designates the process by which rules
    in a grammar are selected and and applied by the "work string".  The inference engine
    may perform a "production" (starting from a start string, usually 'S') or a
    "membership test" (analysis, parsing) assessing whether a given string belongs to
    the language generated by the grammar.
• "Production" is also called "modus ponens", and analysis "modus tollens", but this
    terminology is more appropriate for inference engines based on logical inference.
### Production
See "Inference engine".
### Analysis
See "Inference engine".
### Parsing
See "Inference engine".
### Rule derivation mode
In "production", there are three derivation modes for rules in a "subgrammar":
• RND (default mode): the position of the derivation is choosen randomly
    in the "work string";
• LEFT: the position of the derivation is the leftmost occurrence of the left argument
    of this rule;
• RIGHT: the position of the derivation is the rightmost occurrence of the left argument
    of this rule;
• If a "subgrammar" is of "LIN" type then all rules are applied in "LEFT" mode.
### Programmed grammars
See "flags"
### Flags
Flags are integer global variables indicating particular states during production by
    a grammar.  This is a generalisation of "programmed grammars".
• A rule like: X --> a /myflag/
    creates a flag labelled 'myflag' and set its value to 1.
• A rule like: /myflag/ X --> a
    will only be candidate if 'myflag' has previously be created and its value is positive.
• Unlike in previous versions of BP2, the flag value is not modified unless specified:
        /myflag - 1/ X --> a
• Flags may be positive or negative in range [-32768,32767].
• Flag names may contain up to 30 characters.  Any character may be used except:
    / + - = < > ≤ ≥ ≠  and tabulations or spaces
• Other flag features:
X --> a /myflag +3/   increments the value of 'myflag' by 3 units.
X --> a /myflag -5/   decrements the value of 'myflag' by 5 units.  Negative values
    are accepted.
X --> a /myflag = 3/   assigns 3 to 'myflag'.
/myflag +3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is positive, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.  When the rule is fired, the value of 'myflag' is incremented by 3 units.
/myflag -5/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is positive, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.  When the rule is fired, the value of 'myflag' is incremented by 5 units.
/myflag = 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is equal to 3, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.
/myflag ≠ 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is unequal to 3, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.
/myflag < 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is smaller than 3, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.
/myflag > 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is greater than 3, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.
/myflag ≤ 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is smaller or equal to 3, and if so, makes
    the rule candidate.
/myflag ≥ 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is greater or equal to 3, and if so, makes
    the rule candidate.
• Be careful that '=' is the assignment operator if found in the right argument of a
    rule, and a comparison operator otherwise.
• A rule may contain several flag conditions, e.g.:
        /myflag ≥ 3/ /myflag < 20/ /otherflag = 4/ X --> a
• In assignments and comparisons, numbers may be replaced with other flags
    or global variables K1, K2, etc., e.g.:
    X -->    a   /flag1 = K1/ /flag2 = flag1/
    /flag1 > K19/   X    -->    b
    /flag2 ≠ flag3/ X     -->    c
• See for example '-gr.tryflag', '-gr.tryflag2', '-gr.tryflag3'
• Note: flag syntax is likely to evolve but it will remain consistent with this one.
### BP grammar
See "true BP grammar"
### RND [Subgrammar type or rule derivation mode]
• As a "subgrammar" type, it means that when producing an item rules may be used in
    a random order.  When analysing an item, RND works like ORD.
• As a rule derivation mode, it means that the position of the derivation, when
    producing items, may be choosen randomly. In parsing mode (analysis), position is
    tried from right to left. (See rightmost context-sensitive derivation in publications)
### LEFT [Rule derivation mode]
When producing an item, this rule will be applied to the leftmost occurrence of
    the left argument in the "work string". In parsing mode, the rightmost occurrence
    of the right argument will be searched.
### Work string
The string representing the musical item being processed by the grammar. In "production"
    mode, it starts with the start string 'S'.  In analysis (parsing) mode, it starts
    with the string under analysis.
### RIGHT [Rule derivation mode]
When producing an item, this rule will be applied to the rightmost occurrence of
    the left argument in the "work string". In parsing mode, the leftmost occurrence
    of the right argument will be searched.
### ORD [Subgrammar type]
A "subgrammar" the rules of which should be applied in (top-down) order in "production",
    and bottom-up order in analysis (parsing).
• Each rule is applied repeatedly until it is no longer candidate. There is no random choice.
### LIN [Subgrammar type]
A "subgrammar" using (context-sensitive) leftmost derivation in "production", and
    (context-sensitive) rightmost derivation in analysis.  See reference manual and
    related publications.
### SUB [Subgrammar type]
A "subgrammar" using (context-sensitive) substitutions.
    A substitution is the simultaneous application of all candidate
    rules in the "subgrammar".
• This type works in "production" mode only.
### SUB1 [Subgrammar type]
Similar to SUB, but substitutions are performed only once.
• This type works in "production" mode only.
• This type is notably used in a "glossary".
### POSLONG [Subgrammar type]
A "subgrammar" in which the candidate rule is selected for the (1) leftmost and (2) longest occurrence
    of its left argument in the "work string".
• This type works in "production" mode only.
• If several rules are candidate the uppermost one is selected. There is no random choice.
### Glossary
• A glossary is a special "subgrammar" that is applied to the "work string" just before
    it is played on the MIDI outup or displayed on the graphic window.  A convenient
    use of glossary is to define instructions that are particular to the sound system.
• For instance, -gl.GeneralMIDI contains the code needed to select sound 'patches' on
    any synthesizer in the "General MIDI" standard.
### TEMPLATES: [Subgrammar type]
A list of 'templates' used by a true BP grammar. See reference manual.
### REC
Starts/stops recording actions as a script (in the script window).
### _randomize
A "grammar procedure" or a "tool".
• On top of a "subgrammar", it picks up an arbitrary seed for the sequence of random numbers
	so that all subsequent random choices become unpredictable.
	This is equivalent to clicking the "New seed" button in the "Random sequence" dialog,
	or calling "Randomize" in a script.
• If "_randomize" is found in an item being played, the sequence of random numbers is
    shifted to an arbitrary position, causing unpredictable choices to occur in "_rndseq",
    "_rndtime", etc.
• The effect of "_randomize" is cancelled by "_srand".
• Related topics: "_srand", "Randomize", "Reset random sequence", "Set random seed",
    "New seed".
### _goto(igram,irul) [Grammar procedure]
This procedure is found in the right argument of a rule.
• _goto(igram,irul) will cause BP2/BP3 to jump to "subgrammar" igram, rule irul, when the rule
    that contains it has been applied.  If (igram,irul) does not point at a candidate rule,
    BP2/BP3 will either execute a "_failed" conditional jump or search a candidate rule in
    subgrammar igram.  If none is found it will jump to subgrammar igram+1, etc. as usual.
• _goto(igram,0) causes to jump to "subgrammar" igram and go on selecting rules according to the
    subgrammar type.
### _failed(igram,irul) [Grammar procedure]
This procedure is found in the right argument of a rule.
• A conditional jump to another "subgrammar" or another specific rule in a
    "subgrammar".  Its syntax is: _failed(igram,irul) in which igram and irul have the
    same meanings as in "_goto".
• The jump will be performed if the rule was selected by a preceding "_goto" or "_failed"
    and it is not a candidate rule.
### _repeat(n) [Grammar procedure]
This procedure is found in the right argument of a rule.
• Indicates that the current rule should be tried n times.
• Alternate syntaxes are _repeat(Kx) and _repeat(Kx = n) where Kx is a parameter
    that may be assigned a fixed value (Kx = n) and/or controlled in real time by an
    external MIDI device.
### _stop [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", forces production to pause
### _printOn [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", starts the display of various stages of the "work string"
    in the "Trace" window
### _printOff [Grammar procedure]
Cancels the effect of "_printOn"
### _print [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", displays the "work string" in the "Trace" window
### _stepOn [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", starts the "step-by-step" mode
### _stepOff [Grammar procedure]
Cancels the effect of "_stepOn".
### _traceOn [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", starts displaying various stages of the "work string"
and traces of all applied rules
### _traceOff [Grammar procedure]
Cancels the effect of "_traceOn".
### _destru [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", destroys the structure of the "work string", notably
    removing parentheses indicating repetitions
### _mm(x) [Grammar procedure]
Sets up the metronome to the 'x' value (in beats per minute)
• This is also a "performance control"
• _mm() should not be used more than once in a selected item or in a grammar, failing to
   which the latest value will be used.
### _srand(x) [Grammar procedure or performance control]
Sets the random generator's seed to 'x' and resets the random sequence.
• On top of a grammar, resetting will take place during computation, before any rule of
    the grammar is applied.
• If placed just before "_rndseq", _srand will force the order of the sequence to a preset
    one that depends on the value of 'x'.
• Values of 'x' are arbitrary, use them only to mark identical sequences or derivations in
    grammars.  The range is 0..32767.
• The effect of _srand(x) is cancelled by "_randomize".
• Using _srand(x) is a proper way of repeating random patterns. However, it is not
    certain that these patterns will remain the same ones each time BP2/BP3 is run.
    Sequences of random choices depend on machines, system versions, BP2/BP3 versions,
    and the grammar itself.
• Related topics: "_randomize", "Randomize", "Reset random sequence", "Set random seed",
    "New seed".
### OFF (quantization)
Cancels the effect of ON (quantization).
### ON (quantization)
When checked, BP2/BP3 will use the quantization setting (in milliseconds) to simplify
    tables containing "sound-object" structures (the phase diagram, see manual).
• The result is a saving of memory space and "computation" time making it possible to
    compute very complex items.
### _script(scriptline) [Performance control]
The script line will be executed at "performance time". Note that the line may be
    a call to another script, etc.
### _scale(name,blockkey) [Performance control]
If microtonal scales have been defined in the Csound instruments file, they can be selected as follows:
• By default, a 12-tone equal-tempered scale is used.
• "name" is the label of the scale, by default "scale_1", "scale_2" etc. (no space)
• "blockkey" specifies the key of the note whose frequency should always match equal-temperament. For instance, if blockkey = 69 then 'A4' will stick to diapason (A4 frequency). Default value of 'blockkey' is stored in the settings.
• If blockkey is 0 in a _scale() statement, it is set to its value found in the settings or by default 60.
• In a _scale() statement, blockkey may be specified as a note, e.g. 'G4', instead of a key number. Beware of using the same note convention as in the grammar...
• _scale(0,blockkey) will reset the scale to equal-tempered, in which case 'blockkey' is irrelevant.
• If exactly 1 scale has been loaded from the Csound instruments file, it will be used by default, i.e. even if no _scale(name,blockkey) instruction is used.
• Values of 'scale' and 'blockkey' are carried through fields of polymetric expressions and not influenced by _chan() nor 
### MIDI format
Musical Instrument Digital Interface: a standard for communications between between
    computers and electronic musical instruments.
### Csound format
• Csound uses two text files as an input: an 'orchestra' file describing sound production
    procedures (a set of virtual instruments), and a 'score' file describing sound events.
• BP2/BP3 (above version 2.6.2) produces Csound score files using its own representation
    of musical items, grammars and scripts, and a minimum amount of information about
    the arguments expected by instruments in the Csound orchestra file.
• Related topic: "Csound implementation"
### Delete «unsigned» chars [Script command]
Deletes specified number of chars in current edit window
### Expand selection window «windowname»
Displays selected "polymetric structure" as interpreted by BP2/BP3.
• Two equivalent interprations are displayed.  The first one is the most compact
    representation (the one used internally by BP2/BP3).  The second one is the complete
    expression, containing no explicit "tempo marker".  The first expression may
    imply a rescaling.
• For instance,
                                   {a b,c d e}
    is interpreted:
        [Rescaled, "dilation ratio" = 2] /2 {a b, /3 c d e}
                                         /3 {a_ _ b_ _,c_ d _ e_}
• This is also a script command.
### Show periods
Rewrites the selection taking into account the "section header".
### Section headers
If a, b, c are sound objects, a sequence may be notated:
    3+4+2/4 abbabccabcca /3 abcccbaab /1 bbb
• Expression "3+4+2", called the "section header", means that sections of the meter
    contain 3, 4 and 2 beats.
• The musical example starts at speed 4, goes on at speed 3 and ends up at speed 1.
• If "Show periods" is applied to this item, the new display will be:
    abba.bcca.bcca.¬
    abc.ccb.aab.b.¬
    b.b
• Thus, periods indicate beat delimitations and line breaks '¬' sections.
• Note that there must be a period before a line break, otherwise the last beat would be
    merged with the first one of the next line.
• The old notation "3/4/2/4 abbabccabcca /3 abcccbaab /1 bbb" is no more valid.
### French convention
Use French names of notes: dob, do, do#, reb, re, re#, mib, mi, mi#, fab, fa, fa#, solb,
    sol, sol#, lab, la, la#, sib, si, si# and octave numbers such that la3 = 440 Hz.

### Quantization «long» milliseconds [Script command]
The minimum significant duration. It is convenient to set quantization to the largest
    acceptable value in order to save "computation" time and space.
• Note that quantization in BP2/BP3 has no effect on long-term accuracy.
### Quantize OFF [Script command]
Cancels the effect of "Quantize ON".
### Quantize ON [Script command]
See "Quantization".
### Reset random sequence  [Script command]
Reseeds the random number generator with the value specified by "Set random seed"

### Run script «filename» [Script command]
Runs the specified script, if found on the disk in current directory.
### _smooth
• Related topic: "Smooth time"
### Smooth time [Script command]
Sets time to smooth.  (See the "Metronome" dialog)
• This means that time streaks will not be generated by the metronome, but by the
   first sequence of objects. This is often associated with "time patterns".
• Related topic: "Striated time"
### _striated
• Related topic: "Striated time"
### Striated time [Script command]
Sets time to striated.  (See the "Metronome" dialog)
• This means that the metronome will generate time streaks on which the pivots of
    "sound-objects" may be placed.
• Related topic: "Smooth time"
### Tempo «long» ticks in «long» secs [Script command]
Sets the time base to specified values.  (See the "Time base" dialog.)
### Time resolution «long» milliseconds [Script command]
Sets time resolution to specified value.  (See the "Time accuracy" dialog.)
### Type «line» [Script command]
When this script is executed, «line» is printed in the window previously selected by
   script instruction "Activate window".
• "Type <return>" inserts line feeds.
### Wait for «key stroke or MIDI event» [Script command]
To define the wait event, the easiest is to check 'REC' in the script window,
    then click 'WAIT FOR:'.
• Examples of correct syntax:
    Wait for g -- waiting for key 'g' to be depressed
    Wait for cmd-r -- waiting for command 'r' to be depressed
    Wait for Eb4 channel 1 -- waiting for a NoteOn on the MIDI input, key E flat,
        octave 4, channel 1
    Wait for mib3 channel 16 -- identical to the third one, in French convention
    Wait for space -- waiting for the space bar to be depressed
    Wait for Start -- waiting for a 'Start' MIDI message
    Wait for Continue -- waiting for a 'Continue' MIDI message
    Wait for Stop -- waiting for a 'Stop' MIDI message
• Clicking the mouse exits any the wait loop.
### Split terminal symbols
When checked, inserts spaces between terminal symbols in items produced by the grammar.
### Split |variables|
When checked, marks variables with vertical lines in items produced by the grammar.
• This is only useful with black and white display.
### Time patterns
Sequences of time intervals characterized by precise ratios, to be used in "smooth time".
• These are processed like (codeless) "sound-objects". They are usually put together in
    the first field of a "polymetric expression".
• Type them at the bottom of a grammar or alphabet.
• Example:
    TIMEPATTERNS:
    t1= 1/1  t2 = 3/2   t3 = 4/3 
    t4  = 1/2
    -----------------------
• Time patterns always start with 't' followed with digits.  Expressions may contain an
    integer or an integer ratio.  An example of polymetric expression using these time
    patterns is: {t1 t3 t4, do5 re5 mi5 fa5 - la5}  (See project '-gr.tryTimePatterns')
### _chan(x) [Performance control]

Sets current Csound instrument to x.
• Range of x is 0..127
• x may also be the name of the instrument as defined in the "Csound instrument file".

Assigns random fluctuations in range +/- x to the velocities of following "sound-objects"
    or "simple notes".
• Range of x is 0..64
• The argument may also be Kx.  See "variable arguments".  In this case it may be
    controlled by a MIDI device during the performance.
• Related topics: "_rndtime", "_srand".
### _rndtime(x) [Performance control]
Assigns random fluctuations in range +/- x to the timings of following "sound-objects"
    or "simple notes".
• 'x' is the fluctuation in milliseconds.
• Range of x is 0..32767.  Values less than the "quantization" will produce no effect.

### _pitchbend(x) [Performance control]
Controls pitchbend in two possible ways. If _pitchrange(r) is not specified or is null
    for the current MIDI channel, then x is the actual MIDI value (range 0..16383).
• If _pitchrange(r) is specified, then x is the correction in cents.
    (Also see "_pitchrange")
### _fixed [Performance control]
_fixed(param) indicates that "Performance parameter" 'param' does not vary.
• This is the default setting for any performance parameter.
• Related topics: "_step", "_cont", "_value", "Performance parameter".

• Related topics: "_fixed", "_cont", "_value", "Performance parameter".
### _cont [Performance control]
_cont(param) indicates that "Performance parameter" 'param' varies continuously.
• The default setting for any performance parameter is stepwise.
• Related topics: "_fixed", "_step", "_value", "Performance parameter".
### _value [Performance control]
_value(param,x) assigns numeric value 'x' to "Performance parameter" 'param'.
• The value may be an integer or floating-point relative number.
• In the present version only 256 '_value(…,x)' statements can be handled with
    different 'x' values.
• Related topics: "_fixed", "_step", "_cont", "Performance parameter".
### Performance parameter
Up to 256 parameters with arbitrary names may be handled by BP2 apart from the
    predefined ones: pitchbend, pressure, modulation, etc. which generate
    MIDI messages and Csound events.
• An arbitrary parameter is automatically created when refered to in a "_value", "_fixed",
    "_cont" or "_step" statement.
• These parameters have no effect on the MIDI output.  A parameter is used by a Csound
    instrument if its name is found as a "Parameter name" in the Csound instrument
    description.
    (See "Csound instruments" in the "Ouput" menu and click the "MORE…" button)
• If a sequence of sound-objects or simple notes is preceded with '_cont(param)',
    the parameter 'param' will be interpolated as explained in
    "Continuous performance control".  In this case, it advisable to use two
    indexes for passing the start and end values over to the instrument.
    (See "Start index" and "End index")
• A typical expression containing a variable parameter named 'blurb':
    _cont(blurb) _value(blurb, 154.2) A4 B4 C4 _value(blurb, -21) D4
• Related topics: "_fixed", "_step", "_cont", "_value", "Parameter name".
### _pitchstep [Performance control]
Indicates that pich should change stepwise between two specified values.
### _pitchcont [Performance control]
Indicates that pich should change continuously between two specified values.
• See "Continuous performance control"

### _presscont [Performance control]
Indicates that channel pressure should change continuously between two specified values.
• See "Continuous performance control"
### _switchon(i,c) [Performance control]

    pedal, this command will have the same effect as pushing the pedal.
• The range for 'i' is 64 to 95.
### _switchoff(i,c) [Performance control]
Sets controller i to 0 on channel c. For instance, if controller 64 is the hold pedal,
    this command will have the same effect as releasing the pedal.
• The range for 'i' is 64 to 95.
### _volumestep [Performance control]
Indicates that volume should change stepwise between two specified values.
### _legato(x) [Performance control]
Indicates that durations of notes in the following sequence will be increased by x% to produce legato effect.
### _staccato(x) [Performance control]

### _articulfixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _articulcont or _articulstep.
### _panfixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _pancont or _panstep.
### _pitchrange(x) [Current channel] [Performance control]
Sets the range of pitchbend control to ± x cents on the current channel. This value
    should reflect the range on the current 'patch' of the MIDI expander.
• For instance, _pitchrange(300) means that pitch modifications will be in the range of
    three semitones above and below the average value.
• Once _pitchrange(x) has been specified on a MIDI channel, subsequent _pitchbend(y)
    messages indicate pitch corrections in cents, with y varying between -x and +x.
    "_pitchrange(0)" [default value] indicates that subsequent _pitchbend(y) messages
    on the current MIDI channels take the actual MIDI value for y (range 0..16383).
### _transpose(x) [Tool]
Transposes notes 'x' semitones higher in the remaining part of the sequence.
• 'x' may also be negative or decimal (down to +/- 0.01).
• Transposition is clipped to the MIDI octave range.
• Transposition is also effective on "sound-objects" whose property "Accept transposition"
    is set to TRUE.
• Transpositions are cumulated over polymetric expressions.
    For instance,
        _transpose(-12) {_transpose(2) A3 _transpose(4) D4}
    will produce the same output as:
       _transpose(-10) A3 _transpose(-8) D4
• _transpose(Kx) is no longer licit.
### _transposecont [Tool]
Following "_transposecont", "_transpose(x)" values are interpolated.
• Try for instance:
    _transposecont _transpose(0) C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 _transpose(12) C4
• "_transposecont" is cancelled by "_transposefixed".
• In the current version, "_transposecont" and "_transposestep" are equivalent.
### _transposestep [Tool]
See "_transposecont".
### _transposefixed [Tool]
Cancels the effect of "_transposecont" or "_transposestep".
### _pitchrate(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]
Sets the rate of continuous change of pitchbend to x samples per second.
### _modrate(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]

Sets the rate of continuous change of volume to x samples per second.
### _panrate(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]
Sets the rate of continuous change of panoramic controller to x samples per second.
### _volume(x) [Performance control]
Controls volume on the current channel (range 0 to 127). The default controller is MIDI
    controller #7 and may be changed by _volumecontrol(). Default value is 90 (as per General
    MIDI specs).
• If button "Reset controllers" is checked on the "Settings" dialog, volumes on
    all channels are reset to default value once an item has been played.
• Range of x is 0..127
• The argument may also be Kx.  See "variable arguments".  In this case it may be
    controlled by a MIDI device during the performance.
### _pan(x) [Performance control]
Controls panoramic on the current channel (range 0 to 127). The default controller is
    MIDI controller #10 and may be changed by _pancontrol(). Default value is 64.
• If button "Reset controllers" is checked on the "Settings" dialog, panoramics on
    all channels are reset to default value once an item has been played.
• Range of x is 0..127
• The argument may also be Kx.  See "variable arguments".  In this case it may be
    controlled by a MIDI device during the performance.
### _volumecont [Performance control]
Indicates that volume should change continuously between two specified values.
• See "Continuous performance control"
### _panstep [Performance control]
Indicates that panoramic should change stepwise between two specified values.
### _pancont [Performance control]
Indicates that panoramic should change continuously between two specified values.
• See "Continuous performance control"
### _volumecontrol(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]
Informs BP2/BP3 that MIDI controller x controls the volume (on the current channel).
• Default value is 7, in agreement with "General MIDI" specs.
### _pancontrol(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]
informs BP2/BP3 that MIDI controller x controls the panoramic (on the current channel).
• Default value is 10, in agreement with "General MIDI" specs.
### Wait for:
When in RECording script mode, this allows you to enter a script line
    "Wait for «key stroke or MIDI event»" interactively.
### Execute
Execute the script displayed in the script window, if any.
### Reset controllers [Settings dialog]
Resets switches, pitch benders, modulation, channel pressure, panoramic and volume
    on all channels once an item has been played. This option is recommended although it may
    be time consuming.
• Note that BP2/BP3 keeps track of the channels on which controllers
    have been changed, so normal reset will only occur on those channels. (Consequently,
    if a controller has been changed by another device than BP2, it may not be reset
    properly.)  However, general reset is forced when invoking "Produce items" if this
    option is checked.
• From version 2.7.4 onward, only those switches that have explicitly be changed by "_switchon"
    are reset.
### Reset controllers OFF [Script command]

### Use time limit ON [Script command]
See "Use time limit".
### Computations
Computation comprizes:
• the "production" of an item by a grammar, or the interpretation
    of text selection as a musical item;
• the expansion of the item as a "polymetric expression"
• the "time-setting" of the expanded expression.
### New seed (Random sequence)
Creates an arbitrary new seed that will be used for random generation. This is the
    'randomize' procedure used by programmers. The new seed will be displayed and may
    be reused to produce exactly the same sequence (with exactly the same grammar).
• This reseeding can be automated if the "_randomize" procedure is placed on top of
    a grammar.
• Related topics: "_srand", "_randomize", "Randomize", "Reset random sequence",
    "Set random seed".
### Rule arrows
<-> --> and <-- are the three derive modes in grammars.
--> means that the rule may be used in "production" only
<-- means that it is to be used in analysis (parsing) only
<-> means that the rule may be used in both modes.
    (This is the usual format for "true BP grammars")
### true BP grammars
These grammars can be used both in "production" and in analysis (parsing).
    See the reference manual. When compiling a grammar, BP2/BP3 checks whether it may be taken
    as a true BP grammar.
### GEN type of a Csound parameter
Indicates the Csound generator used with function tables describing variations of this
    parameter.  GEN07 (linear interpolation) is assumed by default.  GEN08 (cubic spline)
    is another option.
### General MIDI
An international standard aimed at making it easy to play MIDI files with predictable
    results on different synthesizers. Basic specifications are a mapping of
    128 typical instruments to 128 program numbers (numbered 1 to 128), and a mapping of
    key numbers to typical percussive sounds (to be played on channel 10).
• In BP2, General MIDI (and customized mappings) is defined as a glossary, namely
    "-gl.GeneralMIDI".  Information about General MIDI may be obtained from Tom White,
    RolandCorp, 7200 Dominion Circle, Los Angeles CA 90040, USA.  You may also contact
    jeff@millie.loc.gov.
### Reset this object
Deletes the displayed "sound-object prototype" and resets its properties to default.
• To delete a sound-object prototype permanently, first reset it and save the '-mi'
    file of "sound-object prototypes". Then delete it from the "alphabet window".
### Play object alone
Play the current "sound-object prototype" at the specified tempo.
### Play sound-object
Play the "sound-object prototype" currently displayed in the prototypes window at the
tempo specified in that window.
### Play expression:
Play item typed in the <any expression> field.
### MIDI sequence
When checked, indicates that this "sound-object prototype" contains a sequence of MIDI 
events that is 'active'. If unchecked, it can mean either that there is no MIDI

### Send dilation ratio to controller:
Create a MIDI message containing "dilation ratio" and send it to the specified
    controller before the first message of the object is sent. Some MIDI devices may
    use this information to modify the sound generation process accordingly.
• If 'alpha' is the dilation ratio (alpha = 1 means no change in the timing), then
    the value sent in this MIDI message is: 32 * log(alpha) + 64
    where 'log' is a decimal logarithm.
• This controller value is clipped to the range 0..127.

### Tempo markers
These are numbers preceded with slashes explicitly indicating the 'speed' of a sequence
    of sound-objects, i.e. the number of sound objects performed in one tick of
    the metronome.  In the beginning of a musical item, other numbers may indicate meter
    sections.  See "Section headers".
• Tempo markers are obsolete. Use "_tempo(x)" in replacement of "/x".
### mm = <metronome value>
This indicates the number of ticks per minute in the "Time base".
### Transpose input notes:
If checked, and if non zero value is specified, then all notes entered from the MIDI
    keyboard are transposed accordingly.  For instance, if the transposition value is
    -3 semitones, the C5 key will be transcribed as A4.
### Performance controls
To display the list of currently implemented performance controls, select
    "Pick tool or performance control" in the "Edit" menu.
• Each control is documented on-line.  These controls are used for
    adding expressiveness to the performance (e.g. _legato, _volume, etc.) or changing
    MIDI parameters (e.g. _pitchbend) that are not mapped to specific "sound-objects".

### Quantization:
Expected accuracy of the positions of "sound-objects".  This may be set to the maximum
    auditive tolerance on the perception of durations. 50ms is a good idea.
• A large quantization requires less memory space and computation time.
### vel

### Speed ratio:
Each cycle of ticks may run at a speed different from the time base.
### MUTE
When checked, prevents tick cycle from being heard.
### _rest

### Set weights
Sets all rule weights in the grammar to a specified value.
### Learn weights (BP2 only)
If the grammar is a "true BP grammar", it is possible to derive rule weights from a set of
    examples, i.e. a set of musical items that could have been produced by the grammar.
• The result is a grammar that produces musical items very close to the ones used for the
    learning process.
• Before learning weights it is advised to save the current ones. See "Save weights".
• Load the examples to the "Data" window and select them, then click "Learn weights".
• The weight of each rule will be incremented by the number of times it has been used during the
    parsing of the sample set.
• At the end of parsing the option is given to add infered weights to current weights, or replace
    current weights with infered weights. The first option is used when several sample sets are
    needed for learning weights.  The second option prompts confirmations: "Keep infered weights
    in current grammar?" and "Update grammar with new weights?".

### Show weights (BP2 only)
Displays the grammar with the current values of its rule weights. This is useful when the production
    of items changes rule weights.
### Load weights (BP2 only)
Changes weights in a grammar according to values previously saved in a '-wg' file. In many cases
    a warning is issued saying that the grammar has been modified since its weights were saved,
    because the weight file keeps a record of compilation time. Be careful not to load weights
    obtained in a grammar with a different arrangement of rules, otherwise BP2 may crash…

### Check variables
If a grammar is loaded and compiled, it lists the variables found by the compiler and
indicates:
• unreachable variables (that can't be generated by the grammar)
• undefined variables (that can't be rewritten by any rule in the grammar)
### Pre-roll
Delay between the first event (MIDI message or Csound event) of a "sound-object" and the
    beginning of its time-span interval.
• Pre-roll is null by default.
• A negative pre-roll amounts to a silence inserted before the first event of the
    sound-object. This silence may for instance be 'protected' thanks to property "Never cover".
• A positive pre-roll allows some events to fall before the on-setting time
    (beginning) of the sound-object. This may be useful if the sound-object contains an
    initialisation sequence that should not be part of its time-span interval.
• A positive pre-roll is also the proper way of compensating a mechanical delay in the
    device producing the sound-object. If for instance the event sequence in the sound-object
    starts with a NoteOn and the device takes 100ms to react, then setting the pre-roll
    to 100ms will displace all MIDI messages by 100ms to the past, so that their effects
    coincide with the desired timings.  Generally you will also set up a positive "post-roll"
    to compensate the delay in setting off events.
• Remember the formula:
    Sound-object duration
        = date of last event - date of first event - pre-roll + post-roll
• Related topics: "Post-roll", "Insert silence"
### Post-roll
Delay between the last event of a "sound-object" and the end of its time-span interval.
• Post-roll is null by default.
• A negative post-roll allows some events to fall beyond the off-setting time (end) of a
    sound-object. This may be useful if the sound-object contains a final sequence of events
    that should not be part of its time-span interval.
• A positive post-roll amounts to a silence appended after the last event of the
    sound-object. This silence may for instance be 'protected' thanks to property "Never cover".
• A positive post-roll is also the proper way of compensating a mechanical delay in setting-off
	the device producing the sound-object. If for instance the event sequence in the sound-object
    ends with a NoteOff and the device takes 50ms to react, then setting the post-roll
    to 50ms will append a 50ms silence after the sound-object to allow the device to finish its
    job. This is generally combined with a positive "pre-roll" compensating on-setting delays.
• Remember the formula:
    Sound-object duration
        = date of last event - date of first event - pre-roll + post-roll
• Related topics: "Pre-roll", "Append silence"
### Cyclic sound-objects
Any sound-object may contain a periodical part starting at an arbitrary point of its
    time-span interval (see "Periodical after").
• BP2/BP3 handles two typical cases:
    1) The sequence of events in the periodical part must be sent again
       to the sound device when that part is repeated.  This happens for instance
       with sound-objects produced by a MIDI synthesizer.
    2) Cyclic properties are defined but there is no need to repeat the sequence in
       the periodical part.  This happens for instance with sound-objects produced
       by a MIDI sampler: the sampler expects BP2/BP3 to trigger the sample with a
       NoteOn and it takes care of repetitions until a NoteOff is received.
  In '-mi.abc1', for instance, 'cycle1' illustrates case 1 and 'cycle2' case 2.
• Property "Discard NoteOff's except in last period" is useful with objects in case 2.
    It prevents the sample from setting off as soon as the first cycle is completed.
    This property is generally combined with "Don't strike again NoteOn's".
• Property "Force integer number of periods" modifies durations making sure that the
    last repetition of the cyclic part is complete.
• It is a good idea to place the object's pivot at the beginning of the periodical
    part.  See "Set pivot".
• If a cyclic sound-object has a negative "post-roll", events falling beyond its off-setting
	time are ignored.
• Beware when setting the startpoint of the periodical part: the balance between
    NoteOn's and NoteOff's should be equal in the periodical part.
    BP2/BP3 compensates some balance problems by avoiding two successive NoteOn's on the
    same key and channel (see "Strike NoteOn's according to default") and appending
    extra NoteOff's after the item when necessary, but an improper balance may result
    in unwanted auditive results.

    "Expand at will", "Compress at will", "Periodical after"
### Periodical after
If this option is checked then the sound-object contains a periodical part starting
	at a defined point of its time-span interval.  The value (in milliseconds or
	as a percentage of the duration) is the duration of the initial non-cyclic part.
• If the sound-object does not have the "Expand at will" property it makes no difference
	to specify the initial non-cyclic part in milliseconds or as a percentage of the duration.
• The last events of a cyclic object may be discarded if its "post-roll" is set to a
    negative value.
• Related topic: "Cyclic sound-objects".
### No period
This sound-object has no periodical part.  This is a default setting.
• Related topic: "Cyclic sound-objects". 
### Force integer number of periods
This property fixes acceptable durations so that the last repetition of the periodical
	part is complete.
• The property is only needed for sound-objects that do not have the "Expand at will"
    property, or that have specified limits for the "Dilation ratio range". However, it
    does not harm to set it with resizable sound-objects.
• Related topic: "Cyclic sound-objects".
### Discard NoteOff's except in last period
This property is used with cyclic sound-objects, notably the ones representing samples
    on a MIDI sampler.  When the object (or part of it) is repeated, then the NoteOff
    encountered at the end of the first cycle may set off the sample, so that the sample
    won't be heard during the following cycles.
• If the property is checked, any NoteOff will be discarded unless it appears in the
    last cycle.
• With this property it is recommended to check "Don't strike again NoteOn's", so that
    no unwanted NoteOff's are produced when NoteOn's are found in the repeated cycle.
• Related topic: "Cyclic sound-objects".
### Strike again NoteOn's
If a NoteOn must be sent while the same key of the same channel is already active
    (because a NoteOn has already been sent) then BP2/BP3 will first send a NoteOff to
    deactivate the key.
This is the default mode in BP2/BP3 (see "Strike NoteOn's according to default").
• Some MIDI sound devices may hang if two successive NoteOn's are sent to the same
    key and the same channel.  BP2/BP3 keeps track of key on/off status to make sure this
    never happens.
• Related topic: "Don't strike again NoteOn's"
### Don't strike again NoteOn's
If a NoteOn must be sent while the same key of the same channel is already active
    (because a NoteOn has already been sent) then BP2/BP3 will ignore it.
• This is not BP2/BP3's default mode: see "Strike NoteOn's according to default"
• Related topics: "Strike again NoteOn's", "Discard NoteOff's except in last period"
### Strike NoteOn's according to default
If a NoteOn must be sent while the same key of the same channel is already active
    (because a NoteOn has already been sent) then BP2/BP3 will behave as per its default
    setting.
• BP2/BP3's default setting is the behaviour defined as "Strike again NoteOn's".
• Related topic: "Don't strike again NoteOn's"
### % of duration
The specified value is a percentage of the sound-object's duration, so the actual
    value will vary according to its "dilation ratio".
### Csound implementation
• Csound is a 100% software environment for the design and transformation of digitized
    sounds.  It runs on most platforms, including MacOS 9 & X, Linux, and Windows.
    Csound is "free software" (open source) distributed under the GNU LGPL license.
• To download Csound, connect to https://csound.com
• BP2/BP3 produces Csound scores in the same way it produces MIDI files or real-time MIDI:
    the "Csound scores" option may be selected in the "Output" menu and is saved with 
    the options of the current project or data.
• Once the option has been selected you may produce a Csound score for each musical item
    produced by a grammar or played from its text representation (a BP2/BP3 "score").  Items
    may be played on real-time MIDI, saved to Csound scores, to MIDI files, or any
    combination of these.
• If the musical item contains simple notes or sound-objects defined as streams of MIDI
    messages, BP2/BP3 converts the stream to a sequence of Csound events, using the
    specifications of Csound instruments defined in a "Csound instrument file".  This file
    can be created and edited in the "Csound instruments" dialog accessible from the
    "Devices" menu.  Csound instrument specifications should contain data that is
    consistent with the "orchestra" file that will be invoked by Csound when compiling
    the score produced by BP2/BP3.
• If no "Csound instrument file" is loaded, BP2/BP3 uses a default instrument which has only
    the start/end timing arguments and accepts pitch in the "octave point pitch-class"
    representation.  It is more clever to design a Cound orchestra with instruments
    accepting parameters like pitchbend, pressure, modulation etc., which BP2/BP3 handles
    in a smart way, using a "vector" representation of continuous parameter changes.
• Sound-object protoypes may also contain Csound scores.  In this case, BP2/BP3 creates a
    score of the musical item arranging these individual scores after changing their
    timings and arguments according to the musical item and specifications of Csound
    instruments.  BP2/BP3 may therefore produce Csound scores using only Csound events and
    Csound instrument specifications as an input, thereby bypassing current limitations
    of MIDI.
• The mapping between Csound argument values (the ones found in the Csound score) and
    MIDI / BP2/BP3 ranges is defined automatically once the user has supplied three typical
    pairs of values.  BP2/BP3 performs linear or quadratic interpolation, plus logarithmic
    mapping if requested to do so.
• In addition, BP2/BP3 handles "Performance parameters" with arbitrary names the values
    of which may be taken as arguments by Csound instruments.
• Related topic: "Csound format"
### octave point pitch-class
In this representation, pitch is represented as a decimal number in which the integer
    part is the octave number and the decimal part is the pitch class.
• For example, the following mapping is used:
C4 = 8.00   D4 = 8.02   E4 = 8.04   F4 = 8.05   G4 = 8.07 
A4 = 8.09   B4 = 8.11
### octave point decimal
In this representation, pitch is represented as a decimal number in which the integer
    part is the octave number and the decimal part is the fraction of the octave.
• For example, the following mapping is used:
C4 = 8.00   D4 = 8.17   E4 = 8.33   F4 = 8.42   G4 = 8.58 
A4 = 8.75   B4 = 8.92
### cps (Hz)
In this representation, pitch is represented in cycles per second (Hertz).
• For example, the following mapping is used:
C5 = 523.25   D5 = 587.33   E5 = 659.26   F5 = 698.46   G5 = 783.99
A5 =  880.00  B5 = 987.77
• These values depend on the settings of the diapason in the "Tuning dialog".

• The box may remain empty if the parameter never varies continuously or the Csound
    instrument is not designed for continuous variation of this parameter.
• Related topics: "Parameter name", "Start argument", "End argument"
### Argument boxes
• The left box contains the index of the Csound instrument argument taking the initial
    value of this control.
• The middle box is only used for "continuous performance control".  It contains the
    index of the argument taking the final value of this control.
• The rightmost box contains the index of the argument taking the reference of the
    function table that BP2/BP3 creates for defining complex parameter variations.
    (See "Continuous performance control")
### Continuous performance control
• A few MIDI parameters such as pitchbend, modulation, volume, channel pressure and
    panoramic may be controlled continuously at a given sampling rate.  For example,
    a portamento may be produced by the following BP2/BP3 score:
        _pitchcont _pitchrate(20) _pitchbend(6000) A4 B4 _pitchbend(9000)
    in which BP2/BP3 will insert 20 pitchbend messages per second.
• Similarly, arbitrary parameters may be handled with effect only on the Csound
   output.  (See "Performance parameter").  For instance,
       _cont(blurb) _value(blurb,154.2) A4 B4 _value(blurb,-21) C4
• The default sampling rate is 50 messages per second.
• Csound events do not allow the insertion of real-time messages. Therefore it is
    necessary to supply the start and end values of the argument which will be
    interpolated by the procedure associated with the Csound instrument.  For instance,
    let the start value of pitchbend be sent as argument 5 and the end value as
    argument 6.  The score produced by BP2/BP3 using the preceding item reads:
        i1 0 1 8.09 6000 7500
        i1 1 1 8.11 7500 9000
   ("8.09" and "8.11" are the respective pitch values of A4 and B4.)
• Another option with Csound is to allow BP2/BP3 to create function tables to control
    the values.  An argument of the instrument should be reserved to passing on the
    table reference.
• Related topic: "Step performance control"
### Step performance control
• By default, all MIDI controls are modified only when explicit values are assigned
    to them by the BP2/BP3 score.  For instance, the following score assigns different
    modulation values to notes B4, C5 and D5:
        _modstep A4 _mod(2000) B4 C5 _mod(9000) D5
    Replacing "_modstep" (which is optional here) with "_modcont" would
    cause continuous changes of modulation at the rate of 50 messages per second.
• In this example it is advisable to check "Reset controllers" since the final value
    (9000) is not the same as the initial one (0).

### Store all items to same file
If checked, all musical items are stored to the same MIDI or Csound score file.
### Change name
Click this button to close the current MIDI or Csound score file and create a new one.
### MIDI file format
BP2/BP3 supports three MIDI file formats: types 0, 1 and 2.  Here are tips for choosing
    an output format:
•	If the file will contain a single musical item, or a sequence of items produced by a
    grammar in the "Improvize" mode, any format is OK.  Keep in mind, however, that
    format 2 may be rejected by single-track MIDI programs.
•	In the current version, BP2/BP3 saves each item to a single track. Types 0 and 1 may
    therefore be considered equivalent.
•	If the file will contain several independent musical items (each of which might
    have a different tempo or time signature), then type 2 must be used.
• BP2/BP3 imports files type 0, 1 or 2.  With format 1 it superimposes the tracks even if
    they have different time signatures.  With format 2, however, an error message
    will be displayed if the file contains several items.
### Convert to Csound
Creates a Csound score attached to this "sound-object prototype" on the basis of events
    contained in its MIDI stream.
• Beware that the result depends on the "Csound instruments" defined in the currently
    loaded '-cs' "Csound instrument file".  If some MIDI controls have no
    mapping to Csound arguments they will simply be ignored.
• If no "Csound instruments" file has been loaded, a default, minimum instrument
    description is used.
• Related topic: "Csound instrument file"
### Import MIDI file
Reads a MIDI file (type 0, 1, 2) and uses its content as a MIDI stream for this
    sound-object prototype.
### Change instrument file
Define or change a '-cs' "Csound instrument file" attached to these "sound-object prototypes".
### Csound instrument file
• This file contains a description of "Csound instruments" used to convert sound-objects
    to Csound scores, or to produce Csound scores from musical items containing
    "sound-objects" and/or "simple notes".
• The file is accessed in the "Csound instruments" dialog of the "Output" menu.
• This description must be consistent with the Csound orchestra file used to
    play items produced by BP2.  This consistency is not checked by the present
    version.
• "Sound-object prototypes" may contain a Csound score that must relate to these
    Csound instruments.

### ADDval
If checked, values of this parameter are combined additively.
• The formula is the following:
    If 'p0' is the parameter value found in the Csound score of a "sound-object", and 'x'
        the assigned value, the parameter value in the resulting score will be: 
    p1 = p0 + x - default
    ('default' is specified in the field "Default value".)
• Related topics: "MULTval", "Default value"
### MULTval
If checked, values of this parameter are combined multiplicatively.
• The formula is the following:
    If 'p0' is the parameter value found in the Csound score of a "sound-object", and 'x'
        the assigned value, the parameter value in the resulting score will be: 
    p1 = p0 * (x / default)
    ('default' is specified in the field "Default value".)
• Related topics: "ADDval", "Default value"
### Default value
The default value of this Csound parameter.  It is used when "sound-objects" contain
    incomplete Csound score lines, and in the combination of parameters (see related
    topics).

### Grammar procedures
A set of tools modifying the application of rules in a grammar.
### Serial music with BP2/BP3
• Version 2.8.1 of BP2 introduced a few tools facilitating the design of musical structures
    following principles of serial music. However, these tools are applied to structures
    that may be more complex than simple sequences of sound-objects: "polymetric expressions",
    polyrhythmic phrases using the "period notation", tree structures constructed with
    "variables" in a grammar, metastructures containing "wild cards", etc.
• The current serial tools are:
    "_retro", "_rndseq", "_rotate", "_ordseq", "_keymap", "_keyxpand".
### _retro [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
This "tool" reverts the order of "sound-objects", "variables", "wild cards" and "time patterns"
    in the remaining part of a sequence.
• Examples
    a b _retro c d e              will become   a b e d c
    a b _retro {c d e,f g}        will become   a b {e d c,g f}      ["polymetric expression"]
    a b _retro {t1 t2 t3,f g}     will become   a b {t3 t2 t1,g f}   ["time patterns"]
    _retro {a b c • d e • f g}    will become   {g f • e d • c b a}  ["period notation"]
    a b _retro c d e _retro f g   will become   a b f g e d c        ["_retro" cancels itself]
• Check the preceding examples in ‘-gr.trySerial’
• Related topics: "_rndseq", "_ordseq", "_rotate".
### _rndseq [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
This "tool" shuffles the order of "sound-objects", "variables", "wild cards" and "time patterns"
    in the remaining part of a sequence.
• Don't confuse with "_randomize" which reseeds the random number generator.
• Examples [each example actually produces several combinations]
    a b _rndseq c d e              could become   a b c e d
    a b _rndseq {c d e,f g}        could become   a b {d e c,g f}      ["polymetric expression"]
    a b _rndseq {t1 t2 t3,f g}     could become   a b {t3 t1 t2,g f}   ["time patterns"]
    _rndseq {a b c • d e • f g}    could become   {b d f • c g • e a}  ["period notation"]
• Check the preceding examples in ‘-gr.trySerial’
• Related topics: "_retro", "_ordseq", "_rotate", "_srand", "_randomize".
### _rotate(x) [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
Rotates a sequence of "sound-objects" or "simple notes" (left shift of 'x' units).
• For instance,
    _rotate(3) A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4  yields  D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 B4 C4
• Rotation is applied recursively and cumulated additively on polymetric structures.
    (See '-gr.tryRotate' for a typical example)
• Range of x is -128..127
• The argument may also be Kx.  See "variable arguments".  In this case it may be
    controlled by a MIDI device during the performance.
### _ordseq [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
This "tool" prevents the remaining part of a sequence from being modified by "_rndseq",
    "_rotate" or "_retro".
• Related topics: "_rndseq", "_retro", "_rotate"
### _keymap(p1,q1,p2,q2) [Performance control]
A performance control for "serial music".
In the following sequence, this "performance control" modifies pitches in range (p1,p2)
    according to a linear mapping in which q1 is the image of p1 and q2 the image of p2.
• The tool makes changes on "simple notes" and on "sound-objects" in which the property
    "Accept key changes" has been set to true.
• Unlike "_keyxpand", changes do not occur during the production of a "grammar",
    but at "performance time".
• p1,q1,p2,q2 may be written as integers (key numbers) in range 0..127, or "simple notes"
    using the current "note convention", e.g.: _keymap(C3,G2,D6,F6).
• See '-gr.tryKeyMap' for typical examples.
• Related topic: "_keyxpand"
### _keyxpand(p,x) [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
• In the following sequence, this "tool" multiplies by x melodic intervals relative to the
    centre note p. For instance,
    _keyxpand(C4,-2) B3 C4 D4 E4   yields  D4 C4 G#3 E3.
• Unlike "_keymap", this tool changes "simple notes" during the production of a "grammar".
• Just like "_retro", "_rndseq" and "_rotate", _keyxpand is applied recursively to the
    fields of a polymetric expression.  Values are cumulated multiplicatively if the centre
    note is the same. For instance,
    _keyxpand(C4,-2) B3 C4 {_keyxpand(C4,-1) D4 E4}  yields  D4 C4 {E4 G#3},
    i.e. the same as  _keyxpand(C4,-2) B3 C4 _keyxpand(C4,2) {D4 E4}.
• _keyxpand also makes changes on "simple notes" and on "sound-objects" in which the property
    "Accept key changes" has been set to true.
• See '-gr.tryKeyXpand' for typical examples.
• Related topic: "_keymap"
### _tempo(x) [Tool]
Multiplies the tempo by 'x'
• The argument may be a floating-point number or an integer ratio.
    Thus, _tempo(4/3) and _tempo(0.35) are valid expressions.
• In "polymetric expressions" tempo values are multiplied.
    For instance, in
        A4 B4 _tempo(2) C5 D5 {_tempo(1.5) E5 F5}
    "E5 F5" is performed at tempo 3 = 1.5 * 2.
• The above example shows that speed change is relative.
    Thus, '_tempo(2)' is not the strict equivalent of '/2' (the obsolete "tempo marker"
    notation) although it should replace it in most cases. "Tempo markers" are kept only
    for compatibility with old BP2/BP3 projects.
### Variable arguments
Some "performance controls", "tools", and rule weights in a grammar, can be given arguments
    notated K1, K2, ... Kx.
• These variables may be assigned fixed values (Kx = n) that are used in the grammar.
• In some cases, Kx can be set by an external MIDI device during the performance.
    (See "Interactive mode").
### MIDI fade-out
• If set to a value 'x' greater than zero, fade-out will append silences of duration 'x' after
    each track of a MIDI file, during which volume decreases stepwise on all channels.
    This compensates for the harshness of terminating the playback of MIDI files.
• Note that this fade-out is performed during a silence and does not affect notes played
    during the performance.  Use "_volume" and "_volumecont" to change volume during
    the performance.
### TIMEPATTERNS
