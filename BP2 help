// This is the help file for Bol Processor BP2.9.4 which is accessed "on-line".
// When editing it, beware that BP2 looks for prefixes, hence if an item is
// the prefix of another item then it should precede it in this file.
### Help
• To access on-line help, type cmd-? or select "Help" in the "Action" menu.
The cursor becomes a question mark.  Select a menu command, click a button or
select any word or group of words you need information about.
• In the "Help" text, expressions between quotes are hyperlinks to more entries.
### BP2 help
The information you are reading now is taken from a text file called "BP2 help".
### Hypertext (HTML)
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a universal text format for electronic documents.
Documents in HTML format can be read by 'Web browsers' such as Mosaic or Netscape Navigator.
Use this format for exchanging BP2 text files via the Internet or multiplatform supports
    like CD-ROMs.
BP2 automatically identifies and converts HTML files.  If a window (grammar, alphabet, script, etc.)
    contains text loaded from a HTML file, it will be saved in the same format unless its name is
    changed and a different format is selected by the user.  (See "BP2 file format").
BP2 identifies the file as a HTML one after finding:
• flag "<HTML>" or "<html>";
• a flag "</…>" where "…" is a non-empty string of alphabetic chars;
• a token "&…;" where "…" is a non-empty string of alphabetic chars;
• a token "&#…;" where "…" is a non-empty string of 1 to 3 digits.
Conversion from HTML to BP2 removes all <> </> flags and translates tokens "&…;" to
    the Macintosh character set.  Unknown characters are replaced with '$'.
Conversion is suspended if a "</html>" flag is encountered.  It is resumed with "<html>".
When converting text to HTML format, BP2 converts high-ASCII characters and a few
    punctuation signs (as per the HTML 3.0 specification) to HTML tokens.  The conversion is
    consistent with the widely accepted mapping between Macintosh characters and ISO 8859-1
    (Latin-1 code).
Character '…' (used for "Undetermined rests") is converted to "_rest".
HTML files are sliced to approximately 80 character paragraphs terminated with CR and LF, which
makes them compatible with DOS/Windows.
### Types-creators
• The following are the prefixes, file types and creators of Macintosh files handled by BP2.
• Starting with BP2.9.6, file extensions are also recognized for each type.  The following
    extensions are also recognized for text files: .txt, .sco, .htm, .html, .trace, .bptr
  Prefix    Exten.  type    creator   description

• All text files may also be stored in "Hypertext (HTML)" format with creator 'MOSS'
    (which is Netscape Navigator).
### BP2 file formats
When saving a file for the first time or after changing its name, the user is given four format
options:
• Normal BP2 file (signature 'Bel0', file type depending on type of data (see "Types-creators");
• Pure text (signature 'Bel0', file type 'TEXT');
• HTML text (signature 'MOSS', file type 'TEXT');
• HTML BP2 (signature 'Bel0', file type depending on type of data (see "Types-creators");
Signature 'Bel0' (registered with Apple) identifies a file as belonging to BP2.  Clicking 
    such files will automatically launch BP2.
Signature 'MOSS' makes the file open directly with Netscape Navigator.
Use HTML BP2 if the file should be reused by BP2 while being readable by Web browsers.
Use HTML text if the file should be able to be opened by other applications that
    understand HTML.  (FFor instance, it needs to be inserted in an electronic mail message
    or to include the file on a web site).
• Pure text files can also be opened by BP2: select 'Open' from the 'File' menu with the
    'option' key down.  (In BP2.9.6 and later, you can also select Show 'All Readable
    Documents' when opening a file to open a text file created by any application).
• Csound scores are stored as Mac text files (default), or DOS or Unix depending on the
    choice in the "File saving preferences" dialog accessed from "Settings"
• MIDI files are saved with type 'Midi' and creator 'Bel0'.
### Why don't I hear any sound?
• If you want to play music on the Mac's internal loudspeaker or via its sound output, either
    use Csound (see "Csound implementation") or QuickTime Music.
    BP2 works with QuickTime Music only if both "Opcode OMS" (Open Music System)
    and QuickTime Music are installed and active.  QuickTime Music is supplied with MacOS.
• "Opcode OMS" (Open Music System) is supplied free of charge by Opcode.
    <http://www.opcode.com> or <ftp://ftp.opcode.com/pub/oms/mac>
• Open the "Control panel" in the "Windows" menu and click "MIDI check output" button. Choose channel 1.
• When QuickTime Music is not used, BP2 produces sounds on a MIDI system.
    A MIDI device (synthesizer or sampler) should be hooked to the Macintosh via a
    standard MIDI interface plugged into the 'modem' port.
• If no sound is heard check the entire MIDI setup: cables, input/output, volume faders,
    channel assignments, etc.  Remember that the interface, MIDI device(s) and amplifiers should
    be powered! If things still don't work, read on...
• If a MIDI keyboard connected to the MIDI input should control a sound device connected to the
    output, it is wise to make sure that MIDI messages are properly received and transmitted by BP2.
    Display the "MIDI filter" in the 'Devices' menu and make sure that required messages are
    transmitted.
• The modem/printer port on some portable computers does not work well with a MIDI interface
    unless "Opcode OMS" (Open Music System) is installed and active.
    Installing OMS is therefore strongly recommended.  (See above)
• If you use OMS and run BP2 in background, e.g. from a FileMaker Pro data-base, make sure that
    "Run MIDI in background" is checked in the "OMS MIDI setup" (see the "Devices" menu).
• When "Opcode OMS" is not active, BP2 uses its in-built MIDI driver.
• To use the built-in MIDI driver with a combined modem/printer port, try this:
    1) PowerBook 150/190: no hope.
    2) PowerBook 5300cs, PowerBook 1400: AppleTalk on and 'Alternate Ethernet' or 'IRTalk' chosen in
        the 'Network' or 'AppleTalk' Control Panel.
        Use BP2's default MIDI output ('modem').
    Choosing Ethernet may result in an error message unless the Mac is really connected to an Ethernet
    adapter with a valid network.  Therefore 'IRTalk' (the infra-red port) is the best solution if
    the machine has an infra-red communication device and the 'IRTalk' extension has been activated
    at startup.
• Read the beginning of the "QuickStart" manual in the documentation for more detailed procedures.
• Related topics: "OMS input-output", "Opcode OMS"
### OMS setting default input device
• BP2 needs to access an existing input MIDI device at startup in order to open the OMS input port.
    This may create a problem when an old device is no longer available and is still recorded in
    '-se.startup'.  This problem occured now if the present help item popped up.
• Below are the guidelines BP2 will follow to solve it:
1) If a default input device was saved in '-se.startup' and connection to it could not be opened,
    BP2 will help you to select a device, modify '-se.startup' and restart;
2) If no default input device was saved in '-se.startup', BP2 attempts to connect to an existing
    input MIDI device. This makes it possible to change the device (see "OMS input-output" in the
    “Devices” menu) without restarting BP2;
3) When modifying '-se.startup' ('File' menu), if an input MIDI device is selected, you will still
    be given the option of setting 'no input device' as the default.
• Related topics: "OMS input-output", "Opcode OMS"
### How can I make music with BP2?
There are three ways of producing music with BP2:
• A grammar may describe a set of musical pieces produced randomly (a formal language) and played
    in sequence -- for instance Mozart's musical dice, see '-gr.Mozart'.
    This is the 'Improvize' mode, in which MIDI input may also be used to monitor processes
    interactively, e.g. synchronise the performance (see the "Interaction" window).
• A grammar may otherwise describe a unique musical piece.  This is particularly useful for
    complex structures that require a comprehensible hierarchical description.
• The third method is to edit or import a musical score, ignoring the inference system.
• Related topics:
"How does the output of BP2 look like?"
"How does the input of BP2 look like?"
"Why don't I hear any sound?"
### What style of music is BP2 dealing with?
• BP2 is not designed for a particular musical style. It stemmed out of formalizing
    music representation and composition tasks in the context of non-western music, notably
    North-Indian rhythm. For this reason it focused on text-oriented representations and formal
    grammmars.  'Bol Processor' originates from the word 'bol' (Hindi/Urdu 'bolna', to speak)
    designating the onomatopeic names of drum strokes in India.
• When MIDI output was designed, elementary musical 'gestures' that produced sounds on drums
    were replaced with "sound-objects", i.e. arbitrary sequences of events encoded as MIDI messages.
• Simplified sound-objects named "simple notes" have later been introduced to facilitate work
    with western tonal systems in English, French or Indian "note conventions".
• BP2 is now able to deal with polyphony, and does it in a smart way. See "polymetric structures".
• BP2 also deals with incomplete representations of polyrhythmic sequences.
    See "period notation".
• BP2 is able to control all MIDI parameters, including continuous parameters such as pitchbend,
    polyphonic pressure, panoramic, etc.  See "performance controls".
• BP2 has interactive features used in the "improvize mode".  It responds to MIDI messages
    (see "Interactive mode") and to "Apple Events".
• Thanks to Csound, BP2 bypasses limitations of MIDI, and takes advantage of both environments.
    (See "Csound implementation")
### How does the output of BP2 look like?
• There are three representation levels:
1) The symbolic level, at which music is represented as a TEXT score. This score uses either
    "simple notes" or "sound-objects" completed with "performance controls".
    Polyphonic items use "polymetric expressions".
    Sequences may use the "period notation".
2) The graphic level, at which "simple notes" or "sound-objects" are shown with their actual
    physical timings.
3) The sound level, a flow of MIDI messages sent in real time to a MIDI device, a MIDI
    file or a Csound score.
• Output options are set in the "Settings" window.  If "Display items" is checked then
    musical items are first displayed as text scores.  This is not recommended for long items.
    If "Show graphics" is checked then graphic scores are displayed while items are played on the
    MIDI output.  If none is checked then items are played directly, but for each item the option
    is given to display the text score.
• A text score may be displayed in graphic and played on the MIDI output: select the text and do
    "Play selection" in the "Action" menu.
### How does the input of BP2 look like?
• A score in text format may be selected and played on the MIDI output: select "Play selection"
    in the "Action" menu.  Try it for example on "C5 C5 C5 D5 E5_ D5_ C5 E5 D5 D5 C5_ _ _".
• Examples of (less trivial) text format scores are stored in '-da' files that may be loaded to
    the "Data" window.  There are more examples in the enclosed data-base "TryAppleEvents.fm"
    which may be opened under Claris FileMaker Pro.
• A grammar is the formal description of a process producing musical text scores which BP2 is able
    to play on its MIDI output.  Load for instance '-gr.Mozart' in the "Grammar" window, then
    type command-R or select "Produce items" in the "Action" window.
• A script is a sequence of meta-instructions performing all operations automatically in BP2.
    Scripts are discussed in the initial part ("QuickStart") of the enclosed MS-Word document
    "BP2 doc - MS Word".
• MIDI files type 0, 1 or 2 can be imported to create "sound-object prototypes".
• Csound scores can be imported to create "sound-object prototypes".
• BP2 responds to input MIDI messages.  See "Interactive mode".
• BP2 works in a client-server environment. It responds to "Apple Events" that may launch all
    kinds of processes.  The data-base "TryAppleEvents.fm" is a good illustration of this.
### Interactive mode
In this mode, BP2 is able to respond in real time to MIDI messages that are assigned certain tasks.
Assignments are listed as script instructions in the "Interaction" window.
    (Open '-in.abc1' to see an example)
• For instance, instruction
        IN Param K1 = controller #7 channel 16
    assigns controller #7 on channel 16 to fix the value of parameter K1.
    This parameter may control weights in grammar rules, velocities, etc. (see "Variable arguments")

### Action menu
Contains most commands of BP2. You may document them with the on-line "Help".
### About Bol Processor…
Displays the version and compilation date of Bol Processor BP2, some credits and 
contact addresses.
### Variables
BP2 recognizes strings starting with an uppercase character as "variables" in grammars
    or in its glossary. It creates a variable if it is not already there, so be careful
    with spelling mistakes.
• You may however start a variable with a lower-case character provided that you write
    it between |vertical bars|.
• Variable names may be of any length and may contain any character (standard or
    extended), digit, or punctuation symbol in the set: \ - _ # @ % $ " % '
• Examples of well-formed variables:
      MyNewTrick  Good_enough  |behind_the_bars|  X67$-J  Big@mac  The"new"thing
      It's_there    De_Noël_à_Pâques
      Peter-Piper-pick'd-a-pick-of-pickl'd-pepper
• Related topic: "Terminal alphabet"
### Polymetric structures
A structure of "sound-objects" represented as a "polymetric expression".
### Polymetric expressions
• An expression denoting a polyphonic or/and polyrhythmic structure of "sound-objects".
    Example:
    {C4 D4 E4,G3 E3} (brackets optional) means that "C4 D4 E4" will be played in the same
    time as "G3 E3".
• BP2 manages to adjust durations.  Here, the duration of each beat is determined by the
    first beat "C4 D4 E4", hence three beats. It will be interpreted:
      /2 {C4_ D4_ E4_,G3_ _ E3 _ _}
    yielding the phase diagram:
        C4 _  D4 _  E4 _
        G3 _  _  E3 _  _
• BP2 uses the same algorithm to deal with polymetric expressions and with "period notation".
• A polymetric expression can contain another polymetric expression, including expressions in
    "period notation".
    Try to play: {C4 D4 E4,{G3,C3} E3} for instance [with "English convention" checked
        in the 'Misc' menu].
• Many commented examples will be found in "-da.checkPoly".
### Undetermined rests
• These are notated '_rest'.
    The old notation '…' (be careful: this is a single character, not three periods!)
    is still valid, but it is not recommended because of character conversion in HTML docs.
• Undetermined rests are used in fields of "polymetric expressions" or in beats of the
	"period notation". The interpreter determines their durations as the ones yielding
	the simplest expanded expression.
• For instance, the sequence
       a b c d • e _rest f • g h _rest i     (also notated    a b c d • e … f • g h … i)
    will be expanded as:
       a b c d • e - _ f • g h - i
• Similarly, the polymetric expression
       {3/2 c d e, _rest f g}       (also notated     {3/2 c d e, … f g})
    will be expanded as:
        /2 {- _ _ c _ d _ e _,- _ _ _ _ f _ g _}
• Each field of a polymetric expression (or each beat of a sequence) may contain
   several undetermined rest.  (This is a recent feature). In this case, these rests
   share equal durations.  For instance,
       {C3 D3 B2, _rest C4 D4 _rest B3}
   is expanded as:
       /8 {C3_ _ _ _ _ _ _ D3_ _ _ _ _ _ _ B2_ _ _ _ _ _ _,
                                     -_ _ C4_ _ _ _ _ D4_ _ _ _ _ -_ _ B3_ _ _ _ _}
   in which each rest has a duration of 3/8 beats.
### Period notation
• Periods are used to indicate 'beats', i.e. sequences of "sound-objects" that are
    constrained to equal symbolic durations. For instance,
        {C4 D4 E4 • G3 E3}    (Brackets {} are optional)
    means that "C4 D4 E4" will be played with the same duration as "G3 E3".
• The duration of each beat is determined by the first beat "C4 D4 E4", hence three
	time units. It will be interpreted:
        /2 C4_ D4_ E4_ • G3_ _ E3_ _
• BP2 uses the same algorithm to deal with period notation and with "polymetric expressions".
    Thus, {C4 D4 E4,G3 E3}  (the period has been replaced with a comma)
    will be interpreted:
        /2 {C4_ D4_ E4_,G3_ _ E3_ _}
    yielding the phase diagram:
        C4 _  D4 _  E4 _
        G3 _  _  E3 _  _
• Many commented examples will be found in example file '-da.checkPoly'.
### Terminal symbols
See "Terminal alphabet"
### Terminal alphabet
• A 'vocabulary' of arbitrary words (terminal symbols) designating "sound-objects".
• Each word is defined in the 'alphabet' window saved as '-ho.filename'.
• A terminal symbol may also be defined at "compile time" if it appears between
    single quotes in the grammar, or if it is used in an out-time "sound-object":
        <<iAmAnOutTimeSoundObject>>.
• A terminal symbol must start with a lower-case character (a..z) or any symbol in the
    set:
        ÄÅÇÉÑÖÜáàâäãåçéèêëíìîïñóòôöõúùûüÆæøÀÃÕŒœÿßØµ∂∑∏πΩƒ∆¥#
• Other characters in a terminal symbol may be any character (a..z, A..Z) or a
    character in the above set, or characters in additional set:
        0123456789#%@¢£§◊$®©™\'"†°`´¨≠∞±≤≥ªº¿¡√«»“”‘’÷
• The above restrictions do NOT apply to terminal symbols defined between single quotes
    in grammars.
• You may define relations (homomorphisms) in a given alphabet.  See: "homomorphism".
• Terminal symbols are mapped to "sound-object prototypes" thanks to the information
    contained in "-mi.filename".  The name of this file should be inserted on top of the
    'alphabet' window.
• BP2 also recognizes predefined terminal symbols called "simple notes".
• Related topics: "Variables", "sound-objects".
### Metavariables
See "Wild cards"
### Wild cards
Symbols '?', '?1', '?2', ... '?n' are used as wild cards in grammar rules.  They may
    be instantiated as a single "terminal symbol", "simple note", "variable", bracket,
    "out-time object", "synchronization tag", "time pattern" or "performance control".
• '?' (an old notation) is equivalent to '?1'.
• If the expression contains several wild cards '?n', values are checked for pattern
    matching.  For instance,
        ?1 ?3 ?2 ?2 ?1 ? ?3
    may be instantiated as a pattern "xyzzxty" in which occurrences of x, y and z must be
    identical.
• The same wildcards may be found in the right argument of a rule.  For instance, the
    following rule will reverse the order of two (distinct) symbols:
        ?1 ?2 --> ?2 ?1
### Compile project
Compiles current alphabet, grammar, interactive codes and glossary (if any).
### Compile time
The time when a grammar is being compiled, or some data is being "tokenized". This may
    be opposed to "performance time".
### Tokenized data
Grammars and musical items are represented with reserved words, "terminal symbols"
    and variables. Before using them, BP2 replaces them with tokens, i.e. numeric
    codes. These codes are not visible to users.
### Performance time
The time when a musical item is being played on the sound output. This may be opposed
    to "compile time".
### Out-time sound-object
• It appears between angle brackets: <<this is an out-time sound-object>>.
• It contains the same sequence of events as an ordinary "sound-object", but its duration
    is forced to zero.  If its label does not appear in the "Terminal alphabet", a new
    terminal symbol will be created at "compile time".
### Null string
A string representing an empty sequence (of "sound-objects").  You may use
    "nil", "lambda", "empty" or "null" (without quotes) to designate a null string.  You
    may also leave the space blank. These are three equivalent notations for the same
    rule:
    S --> nil
    S --> lambda
    S --> empty
    S --> null
    S -->
### Simple notes
These are predefined terminal symbols mapped to predefined "sound-objects"
    containing only a NoteOn / NoteOn pair of MIDI messages.  These "sound-objects"
    are relocatable and have pivots at their beginnings. They can be rescaled at will,
    they can be truncated or covered by neighbouring "sound-objects".  Their "pre-roll" and
    "post-roll" settings are nil.
• The conventional 440Hz tone may be written 'A4', 'la3' or 'dha4', depending on the
    note convention set in the 'Misc' menu, and the one in the "Tuning" dialog.
• See: "English convention", "French convention", "Indian convention","Key numbers".
### MIDI [Devices menu]
This menu item can be toggled.  When checked, items produced by the grammar are played
    using the real-time MIDI output device.
• This setting is also available in the "Input-output settings" window as "Use MIDI in/out".
• May be modified with the script commands "Use MIDI OFF" and "Use MIDI ON"
• Related Topics:  "MIDI format"
### Use MIDI in/out
When checked, items produced by the grammar are played using the real-time MIDI
    output device.
• This setting is also available in the 'Devices' menu as "MIDI".
• May be modified with the script commands "Use MIDI OFF" and "Use MIDI ON"
• Related Topics:  "MIDI format"
### Use MIDI OFF [Script command]
Turns off real-time MIDI output.  See "Use MIDI in/out".
### Use MIDI ON [Script command]
Turns on real-time MIDI output.  See "Use MIDI in/out".
### Tuning dialog
This dialog makes it possible to modify the MIDI keyboard mapping and diapason
    reference used by Csound.
• Usually, key 60 is assigned to C4 (do3 in French, sa4 in Indian), but some MIDI programs,
    notably old versions of BP2, use alternate note names such as C5 (do4).
• The diapason value has no effect on the MIDI output.  Its is used by Csound for
    instruments requiring a "cps (Hz)" format for pitch.
### Csound
Displays the Csound score attached to this "sound-object prototype".
### Csound tuning
See "Tuning dialog".
### A4 / la3 / dha4 frequency is
See "Tuning dialog".
### MIDI mapping
See "Tuning dialog".
### C4 / do3 / sa4  is MIDI key
See "Tuning dialog".
• A4 is conventionally 440Hz but you may want to change it if your Mac gets too hot :-)
### Relocatable sound-object
A "sound-object" that may be relocated by the "time-setting algorithm".
### Sound objects
See "Sound-objects"
### Sound-objects
See the reference manual and publications.
• In short, a sound-object in BP2 is a sequence of 'elementary' events, such as MIDI
    or Csound instructions.
• A typical simple sound-object is a "simple note", i.e. a NoteOn/NoteOff
    pair on the same MIDI key and channel.
• Sound-objects are designated by "terminal symbols". Each object is mapped to
    a unique "sound-object prototype" bearing the same name, which defines its metric
    and topologic properties.  (See reference manual).
### Sound-object prototypes
These contain information about "sound-objects" bearing the same name: the list of
elementary events, and metric and topologic properties used by the "time-setting algorithm".
• Elementary events may be MIDI events, Csound events, or both.
### Time-setting algorithm
An algorithm used by BP2 to calculate the timings of elementary events (e.g.
   MIDI or Csound events) in a musical item. It takes into account the properties of
    "sound-objects" (defined by their "sound-object prototypes") and may relocate or
    truncate objects in order to satisfy all constraints arising therefrom.
### Homomorphism
This is an optional relation on the "terminal alphabet" used by a grammar. It is
    defined over all the terminal symbols and identified by a label. For
    instance, let us call TRANS the one-semitone upward transposition in an alphabet of
    notes. The alphabet file (saved as "-ho.mynotes") would begin like this:
        TRANS
        do0 --> do#0 --> re0 --> re#0  etc... --> si9
• If a "terminal alphabet" uses no homomorphism then arrows "-->" should of course not
    be found.
• You can define several homomorphisms in the same alphabet. Separate them by lines
    of hyphens (just like "subgrammars").
• If an homomorphism has been declared, the last terminal of a line is mapped to
    itself, unless it is defined cyclically. In the example above it would mean that
    si9 --> si9.  But we could as well use a cyclic definition:
        do0 --> do#0 --> re0 --> re#0  etc... --> si9 --> do0
### Derivation mode
See "Subgrammar type" and "Rule derivation mode"
### Subgrammars
A grammar may be "sliced" in several subgrammars that will be applied successively
    to the "work string" for producing derivations.  A new subgrammar is applied only
    once there is no more candidate rule in the current subgrammar. You may however
    bypass this rule by using jumps like _goto() or _failed().
• In analysis (parsing) mode, subgrammars are applied in the reverse order.
### Subgrammar type
The strategy followed by the "inference engine" to produce or analyze an item using
    the rules of this "subgrammar". See: "RND", "ORD", "LIN", "SUB", "SUB1".
### Inference engine
The term is borrowed from expert systems. It designates the process by which rules
    in a grammar are selected and and applied by the "work string".  The inference engine
    may perform a "production" (starting from a start string, usually 'S') or a
    "membership test" (analysis, parsing) assessing whether a given string belongs to
    the language generated by the grammar.
• "Production" is also called "modus ponens", and analysis "modus tollens", but this
    terminology is more appropriate for inference engines based on logical inference.
### Production
See "Inference engine".
### Analysis
See "Inference engine".
### Parsing
See "Inference engine".
### Rule derivation mode
In "production", there are three derivation modes for rules in a "subgrammar":
• RND (default mode): the position of the derivation is choosen randomly
    in the "work string";
• LEFT: the position of the derivation is the leftmost occurrence of the left argument
    of this rule;
• RIGHT: the position of the derivation is the rightmost occurrence of the left argument
    of this rule;
• If a "subgrammar" is of "LIN" type then all rules are applied in "LEFT" mode.
### Programmed grammars
See "flags"
### Flags
Flags are integer global variables indicating particular states during production by
    a grammar.  This is a generalisation of "programmed grammars".
• A rule like: X --> a /myflag/
    creates a flag labelled 'myflag' and set its value to 1.
• A rule like: /myflag/ X --> a
    will only be candidate if 'myflag' has previously be created and its value is positive.
• Unlike in previous versions of BP2, the flag value is not modified unless specified:
        /myflag - 1/ X --> a
• Flags may be positive or negative in range [-32768,32767].
• Flag names may contain up to 30 characters.  Any character may be used except:
    / + - = < > ≤ ≥ ≠  and tabulations or spaces
• Other flag features:
X --> a /myflag +3/   increments the value of 'myflag' by 3 units.
X --> a /myflag -5/   decrements the value of 'myflag' by 5 units.  Negative values
    are accepted.
X --> a /myflag = 3/   assigns 3 to 'myflag'.
/myflag +3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is positive, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.  When the rule is fired, the value of 'myflag' is incremented by 3 units.
/myflag -5/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is positive, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.  When the rule is fired, the value of 'myflag' is incremented by 5 units.
/myflag = 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is equal to 3, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.
/myflag ≠ 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is unequal to 3, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.
/myflag < 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is smaller than 3, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.
/myflag > 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is greater than 3, and if so, makes the rule
    candidate.
/myflag ≤ 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is smaller or equal to 3, and if so, makes
    the rule candidate.
/myflag ≥ 3/ X --> a   checks that 'myflag' is greater or equal to 3, and if so, makes
    the rule candidate.
• Be careful that '=' is the assignment operator if found in the right argument of a
    rule, and a comparison operator otherwise.
• A rule may contain several flag conditions, e.g.:
        /myflag ≥ 3/ /myflag < 20/ /otherflag = 4/ X --> a
• In assignments and comparisons, numbers may be replaced with other flags
    or global variables K1, K2, etc., e.g.:
    X -->    a   /flag1 = K1/ /flag2 = flag1/
    /flag1 > K19/   X    -->    b
    /flag2 ≠ flag3/ X     -->    c
• See for example '-gr.tryflag', '-gr.tryflag2', '-gr.tryflag3'
• Note: flag syntax is likely to evolve but it will remain consistent with this one.
### BP grammar

### 0 (Number streaks from…)
Refers to the numbering of time streaks on graphics
### 1 (Number streaks from…)
Refers to the numbering of time streaks on graphics
### RND [Subgrammar type or rule derivation mode]
• As a "subgrammar" type, it means that when producing an item rules may be used in
    a random order.  When analysing an item, RND works like ORD.
• As a rule derivation mode, it means that the position of the derivation, when
    producing items, may be choosen randomly. In parsing mode (analysis), position is
    tried from right to left. (See rightmost context-sensitive derivation in publications)
### LEFT [Rule derivation mode]
When producing an item, this rule will be applied to the leftmost occurrence of
    the left argument in the "work string". In parsing mode, the rightmost occurrence
    of the right argument will be searched.
### Work string
The string representing the musical item being processed by the grammar. In "production"
    mode, it starts with the start string 'S'.  In analysis (parsing) mode, it starts
    with the string under analysis.
### RIGHT [Rule derivation mode]
When producing an item, this rule will be applied to the rightmost occurrence of
    the left argument in the "work string". In parsing mode, the leftmost occurrence
    of the right argument will be searched.
### ORD [Subgrammar type]
A "subgrammar" the rules of which should be applied in (top-down) order in "production",
    and bottom-up order in analysis (parsing).
• Each rule is applied repeatedly until it is no longer candidate. There is no random choice.
### LIN [Subgrammar type]
A "subgrammar" using (context-sensitive) leftmost derivation in "production", and
    (context-sensitive) rightmost derivation in analysis.  See reference manual and
    related publications.
### SUB [Subgrammar type]
A "subgrammar" using (context-sensitive) substitutions.
    A substitution is the simultaneous application of all candidate
    rules in the "subgrammar".
• This type works in "production" mode only.
### SUB1 [Subgrammar type]
Similar to SUB, but substitutions are performed only once.
• This type works in "production" mode only.
• This type is notably used in a "glossary".
### POSLONG [Subgrammar type]
A "subgrammar" in which the candidate rule is selected for the (1) leftmost and (2) longest occurrence
    of its left argument in the "work string".
• This type works in "production" mode only.
• If several rules are candidate the uppermost one is selected. There is no random choice.
• A typical use of POSLONG subgrammars is the transcoding of alphabets, see "Transliterate text file".
### Glossary
• A glossary is a special "subgrammar" that is applied to the "work string" just before
    it is played on the MIDI outup or displayed on the graphic window.  A convenient
    use of glossary is to define instructions that are particular to the sound system.
• For instance, -gl.GeneralMIDI contains the code needed to select sound 'patches' on
    any synthesizer in the "General MIDI" standard.
### TEMPLATES: [Subgrammar type]
A list of 'templates' used by a true BP grammar. See reference manual.
### Close window
Hides the current window.  Unlike most other Mac applications, this operation does not close
    the file currently loaded in the window (if any), and if the window is redisplayed (from
    the 'Windows' menu, for example), the contents of the window will be unchanged.
EXCEPTIONS:  The Trace and Help windows are cleared when they are closed.  BP2 may also 
    automatically clear the Trace and Notice windows at other times.  It is not advisable
    to store important text that you create in these windows.  Use the Scrap window instead.
IMPORTANT:  The first time you choose "Close Window", you will be prompted to save any unsaved
    changes just as in other programs.  Beware that if you choose "No", you may not be asked 
    again to save your changes before loading another file or project or before quitting BP2.
    We understand that this a potentially confusing situation and are considering how to 
    redesign the interface taking into consideration BP2's special needs. 
### Save file
Saves the current window to its corresponding file on disk.  You will be prompted for
a location if there is not an existing file for this window.
### Save file as…
Prompts you for a location to save the current window to a file on disk.
### Revert to saved...
Throws away any changes that have been made to the current window and reloads it from
    the version saved on disk.  You will prompted to confirm this operation before any
    data is lost.
### Clear
Clears the current window. This is also a script command.
### REC
Starts/stops recording actions as a script (in the script window).
### _randomize
A "grammar procedure" or a "tool".
• On top of a "subgrammar", it picks up an arbitrary seed for the sequence of random numbers
	so that all subsequent random choices become unpredictable.
	This is equivalent to clicking the "New seed" button in the "Random sequence" dialog,
	or calling "Randomize" in a script.
• If "_randomize" is found in an item being played, the sequence of random numbers is
    shifted to an arbitrary position, causing unpredictable choices to occur in "_rndseq",
    "_rndtime", etc.
• The effect of "_randomize" is cancelled by "_srand".
• Related topics: "_srand", "Randomize", "Reset random sequence", "Set random seed",
    "New seed".
### _goto(igram,irul) [Grammar procedure]
This procedure is found in the right argument of a rule.
• _goto(igram,irul) will cause BP2 to jump to "subgrammar" igram, rule irul, when the rule
    that contains it has been applied.  If (igram,irul) does not point at a candidate rule,
    BP2 will either execute a "_failed" conditional jump or search a candidate rule in
    subgrammar igram.  If none is found it will jump to subgrammar igram+1, etc. as usual.
• _goto(igram,0) causes to jump to "subgrammar" igram and go on selecting rules according to the
    subgrammar type.
### _failed(igram,irul) [Grammar procedure]
This procedure is found in the right argument of a rule.
• A conditional jump to another "subgrammar" or another specific rule in a
    "subgrammar".  Its syntax is: _failed(igram,irul) in which igram and irul have the
    same meanings as in "_goto".
• The jump will be performed if the rule was selected by a preceding "_goto" or "_failed"
    and it is not a candidate rule.
### _repeat(n) [Grammar procedure]
This procedure is found in the right argument of a rule.
• Indicates that the current rule should be tried n times.
• Alternate syntaxes are _repeat(Kx) and _repeat(Kx = n) where Kx is a parameter
    that may be assigned a fixed value (Kx = n) and/or controlled in real time by an
    external MIDI device.
### _stop [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", forces production to pause
### _printOn [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", starts the display of various stages of the "work string"
    in the "Trace" window
### _printOff [Grammar procedure]
Cancels the effect of "_printOn"
### _print [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", displays the "work string" in the "Trace" window
### _stepOn [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", starts the "step-by-step" mode
### _stepOff [Grammar procedure]
Cancels the effect of "_stepOn".
### _traceOn [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", starts displaying various stages of the "work string"
and traces of all applied rules
### _traceOff [Grammar procedure]
Cancels the effect of "_traceOn".
### _destru [Grammar procedure]
When encountered in "production", destroys the structure of the "work string", notably
    removing parentheses indicating repetitions
### _mm(x) [Grammar procedure]
Sets up the metronome to the 'x' value (in beats per minute)
• This is also a "performance control"
• _mm() should not be used more than once in a selected item or in a grammar, failing to
   which the latest value will be used.
### _srand(x) [Grammar procedure or performance control]
Sets the random generator's seed to 'x' and resets the random sequence.
• On top of a grammar, resetting will take place during computation, before any rule of
    the grammar is applied.
• If placed just before "_rndseq", _srand will force the order of the sequence to a preset
    one that depends on the value of 'x'.
• Values of 'x' are arbitrary, use them only to mark identical sequences or derivations in
    grammars.  The range is 0..32767.
• The effect of _srand(x) is cancelled by "_randomize".
• Using _srand(x) is a proper way of repeating random patterns. However, it is not
    certain that these patterns will remain the same ones each time BP2 is run.
    Sequences of random choices depend on machines, system versions, BP2 versions,
    and the grammar itself.
• Related topics: "_randomize", "Randomize", "Reset random sequence", "Set random seed",
    "New seed".
### OFF (quantization)
Cancels the effect of ON (quantization).
### ON (quantization)
When checked, BP2 will use the quantization setting (in milliseconds) to simplify
    tables containing "sound-object" structures (the phase diagram, see manual).
• The result is a saving of memory space and "computation" time making it possible to
    compute very complex items.
### _script(scriptline) [Performance control]
The script line will be executed at "performance time". Note that the line may be
    a call to another script, etc...
### New Project
"New project" erases the current project (grammar and "terminal alphabet").
• This is also a script command.
### Load
Loads a file.
### Load Project «filename» [Script command]
Erases the current project and loads a new one (grammar and "terminal alphabet") along
    with attached settings (-se.file), interactive codes (-in.file) and glossary (-gl.file).
• BP2 will read the name of the corresponding '-ho' "Terminal alphabet" file in the grammar
    file and, if found, will load the alphabet file automatically.
### Load Project... [File menu]
Erases the current project and loads a new one (grammar and "terminal alphabet") along
    with attached settings (-se.file), interactive codes (-in.file) and glossary (-gl.file).
• You will be prompted to select a grammar file.
• BP2 will read the name of the corresponding '-ho' "Terminal alphabet" file in the grammar
    file and, if found, will load the alphabet file automatically.
• This is also a script command: "Load Project «filename»"
### Check script syntax
Checks the syntax of the script displayed in the "Script" window, and of other scripts
    called at the time the current script is executed.
• Even if the syntax is correct, it may be necessary to update directory information in
    case a file used by the script has been moved.  This will be done automatically when
    invoking this command.
• Tip: if you want to save time on checking scripts, you should put aliases of all
    files used by a script into the same folder.
### Alphabet (cmd-H)
"Alphabet" brings to front the "Terminal alphabet" window, which may contain a '-ho' file.
• This is also a script command.
### Glossary
"Glossary" brings to front the 'glossary' window, which may contain a '-gl' file.
• This is also a script command.
### Clear
Clears current selection. This is also a script command.
### Cut
Cuts  current selection. This is also a script command.
### Copy
Copies current selection. This is also a script command.
### Paste
Pastes the content of scrap in replacement of current selection.
• This is also a script command.
### Find… replace
Finds and replaces strings. It accepts special characters:
  ^t  for tabulation
  ^r or ^p for paragraph
  ^n for new line
• This is also a script command.
### Control panel
Brings to front the control panel. This is also a script command.
### Data (cmd-D)
"Data" brings to front the "Data" window, which may contain a '-da' file.
• This is also a script command.
### Grammar (cmd-G)
"Grammar" brings to front the "Grammar" window, which may contain a '-gr' file.
• This is also a script command.
### Graphics
Brings to front the "Graphics" window. This is also a script command.
### Interaction
"Interaction" brings to front the "Interaction" window, which may contain a '-in' file.
• See "Interactive mode".
• This is also a script command.
### Scrap
"Scrap" brings to front the "Scrap" window, which may contain whatever you want.
    Scrap is saved as pure text.
• This is also a script command.
### Info
"Info" brings to front the "Info" window. It should not be used to type any
    data because it may be erased without warning.
• This is also a script command.
### Keyboard
"Keyboard" brings to front the "Keyboard" window, which may contain tokens loaded from
    a '-kb' file. (See "Type tokens")
• This is also a script command.
### Settings
Brings to front the two "Settings" windows.
• This is also a script command.
### Objects (cmd-E)
"Objects" gives access to the "sound-object" editor.
• This is also a script command.
### Produce items (cmd-R)
This 'runs' the current project: alphabet and grammar are compiled, then items are
    produced, displayed, played on the MIDI output, etc., depending on the settings.
    (See "Settings")
• Beware of the settings because they may force "production" to
    continue forever ("Improvize") or the item to be played repeatedly ("Cyclic play").
• This is also a script command.
### Produce and play «int» items [script command]
Uses the current grammar to produce the specified number of items. It sets "Cyclic play"
    to "false".
### Play «any item» [Script command]
Play specified item.  An item is an expression containing "terminal symbols",
    "simple notes" and "performance controls".
### Play-show «int» times selection in window «windowname» [script command]
Plays the selection several times.
### Set output window «windowname» [script command]
Displays grammar productions in specified window. Default is "Data".
### Produce templates
If the grammar is a 'true BP' grammar (see manual) then "Produce templates" creates
    all templates generated/recognized by the current grammar, and displays them at
    the end of the grammar.  (See "-gr.dhin--" for example.)
• This is also a script command.
### Quit
To quit BP2.
• This is also a script command.
### Randomize [Script command]
Creates a new random seed (based on the internal clock). This allows future random
    choices to take place unpredictably.
• Calling "Randomize" in a script produces the same effect as inserting "_randomize"
    on top of a grammar, or clicking the "New seed" button in the "Random sequence" dialog.
• Related topics: "_randomize", "_srand", "Reset random sequence", "Set random seed",
    "New seed".
### Script
This brings to front the "Script" window.
• This is also a script command.
### Start string
This brings to front the "Start string" window.
• This is also a script command.
### Trace
This brings to front the "Trace" window.
• This is also a script command.
### Activate window «windowname» [Script command]
Brings to front specified window and makes it active.
### Hide window «windowname» [Script command]
Hides specified window (and erases its content if it is 'Help', 'Graphics' or 'Trace').
### Analyze selection in window «windowname»
Analyses the selected item using the current grammar.
• This is possible only if it is a 'true BP' grammar (see manual), which BP2
    will recognize.
• If the result is 'S' then the item belongs to the language produced by the grammar.
• This is also a script command.
### Buffer size «long» symbols [Script command]
Sets the limit of the "work string".
• It will increase automatically once the limit has been reached.
• This is a good way of controlling the length of items produced by a grammar
    describing an infinite language.
• Related topics: "don't stop [computation]", "stop [computation]", "Default buffer size"
### Default buffer size «long» symbols [Script command]
Sets the value of "Buffer size" in the beginning of a "production".
• Related topics: "don't stop [computation]", "stop [computation]", "Buffer size"
### don't stop [computation]
When checked, allows the "work string" ("Buffer size") to grow indefinitely.
• This is risky if the grammar contains self-imbedding rules and no control on derivations.
• Related topics: "stop [computation]", "Buffer size", "Default buffer size"
### stop [computation]
When checked, prompts the user to allow the "work string" ("Buffer size") to grow beyond
   a specified limit.
• This is convenient when the grammar contains self-imbedding rules, and no other control
   on derivations.
• Related topics: "don't stop [computation]", "Buffer size", "Default buffer size"
### Clear window «windowname» [Script command]
Clears specified window
### Define «variable» «sound item» [Script command in glossary]
This a 'glossary' instruction allowing a variable (any string starting with an uppercase
    character) to be replaced with an expression that makes sense to the sound output. A
    typical case is the assignment of MIDI program numbers (the 'patches' of a synthesizer)
    to names denoting different 'instruments'.
• See for instance '-gl.GeneralMIDI' for standard names of instruments in
    the "General MIDI" standard.
### MIDI format
Musical Instrument Digital Interface: a standard for communications between between
    computers and electronic musical instruments.
### Csound format
• Csound uses two text files as an input: an 'orchestra' file describing sound production
    procedures (a set of virtual instruments), and a 'score' file describing sound events.
• BP2 (above version 2.6.2) produces Csound score files using its own representation
    of musical items, grammars and scripts, and a minimum amount of information about
    the arguments expected by instruments in the Csound orchestra file.
• Related topic: "Csound implementation"
### Delete «unsigned» chars [Script command]
Deletes specified number of chars in current edit window
### Expand selection window «windowname»
Displays selected "polymetric structure" as interpreted by BP2.
• Two equivalent interprations are displayed.  The first one is the most compact
    representation (the one used internally by BP2).  The second one is the complete
    expression, containing no explicit "tempo marker".  The first expression may
    imply a rescaling.
• For instance,
                                   {a b,c d e}
    is interpreted:
        [Rescaled, "dilation ratio" = 2] /2 {a b, /3 c d e}
                                         /3 {a_ _ b_ _,c_ d _ e_}
• This is also a script command.
### Show periods
Rewrites the selection taking into account the "section header".
### Section headers
If a, b, c are sound objects, a sequence may be notated:
    3+4+2/4 abbabccabcca /3 abcccbaab /1 bbb
• Expression "3+4+2", called the "section header", means that sections of the meter
    contain 3, 4 and 2 beats.
• The musical example starts at speed 4, goes on at speed 3 and ends up at speed 1.
• If "Show periods" is applied to this item, the new display will be:
    abba.bcca.bcca.¬
    abc.ccb.aab.b.¬
    b.b
• Thus, periods indicate beat delimitations and line breaks '¬' sections.
• Note that there must be a period before a line break, otherwise the last beat would be
    merged with the first one of the next line.
• The old notation "3/4/2/4 abbabccabcca /3 abcccbaab /1 bbb" is no more valid.
### Prompt ON [Script command]
Cancels the effect of "Prompt OFF".
### Prompt OFF [Script command]
When encountered in a script, all "wait for..." instructions and
    interactive commands are bypassed until the "Prompt ON" instruction resets interactivity
    to normal. This is a useful debugging technique allowing a script to be executed
    without interruption.
### Freeze windows ON [Script command]
"Freeze windows on" prevents BP2 from recording the new positions and sizes of windows
    when saving the settings of the current project.  It also prevents windows from being moved
    or resized when new settings are loaded.  This is very useful when running a script that
    sequentially loads and plays several projects.  You can reverse the effects of this command
    with "Freeze windows OFF".
### Freeze windows OFF [Script command]
Cancels the effects of Freeze windows ON.
### Graphic scale «long» pixels = «long» milliseconds [Script command]
Changes settings of the graphics window. (See "Graphic settings" dialog)
### Open file «filename» [Script command]
Opens a file. Different windows may force you to open certain types of files only.
### Open file... [File menu]
Opens a file that you select in the current window. Each window will only allow you to open
    appropriate types of files.  (eg. the grammar window only allows opening grammar files
    and text files which BP2 assumes are grammars).  Any type of (text) file may be opened
    in the Scrap window.  To force BP2 to allow you to select any file, hold down the Option
    key while opening the File menu and choosing this command.
• This is also a script command: "Open file «filename»".
### Load settings «filename» [Script command]
Loads settings for a specified work environment or project.
### Load settings... [File menu]
Prompts you to select a settings file which BP2 then loads.  Settings files allow you save
   and restore a specific work environment including computation and input-output settings,
   window positions and text sizes, etc. -- essentially, all BP2 configuration options
   accessible from the 'Settings' menu are included.
• This is also a script command: "Load settings «filename»".
### Save settings [File menu]
Saves all settings for the current working environment -- including computation, 
   input-output settings, window positions, window text sizes, and most other configuration
   options accessible from the 'Settings' menu and elsewhere -- to a file on disk.
NOTE: If the current settings were already loaded from or saved to disk, then the title
   of this menu item will change to reflect the name of the current settings file.  That
   file will be the one that is saved to when this menu item is chosen.
• If there is no current settings file, then this command behaves like "Save settings as..."
### Save settings as... [File menu]
Saves all settings for the current working environment -- including computation, 
   input-output settings, window positions, window text sizes, and most other configuration
   options accessible from the 'Settings' menu and elsewhere -- to a file on disk.
   You will be prompted to choose a location and the name of the file that you specify
   will be added to the top of the grammar and data windows so that it can be automatically
   loaded with those files.  
### Modify ‘-se.startup’... [File menu]
Saves all settings for the current working environment to a special file named "-se.startup".
   This settings file is automatically loaded when Bol Processor is launched.
• See "-se.startup" for more information.
### -se.startup
This settings file is automatically loaded when Bol Processor is launched.  On MacOS X, it is
    stored inside of your user folder in the 'Bol Processor' subfolder of the 'Preferences'
    folder inside of your 'Library' folder.  If this file does not exist at launch time, BP2
    will try to create it from a default copy inside of the Bol Processor application package.
    If it is unable to create it, then BP2 will try to open the file in the application
    package.  On MacOS 9, this file is expected to be in the same folder as the BP2 application.
NOTE:  BP2 will not find this file if you rename it or move it.  It cannot be named 
    'startup.bpse' either; it must be '-se.startup'. 
### Maximum production time «long» ticks [Script command]
Sets the maximum time during which items will be produced. Time is measured in
    ticks, i.e. 60ths of a second. Beware that the effect will depend on the speed of
    the machine. In general it is better to specify the number of items to produce.

### Receive MIDI data to file...
This command allows you to store in-coming MIDI data to a text file. It may be used,
    for instance, to save the set-up of any MIDI device using its bulk transfer facility.
• Time information is not saved, i.e. this is convenient for system exclusive messages.
• Note: on a slow machine like Mac II-ci you won't be able to receive a bulk transfer
    properly. Some data gets lost. If you have such problems, use the 'D-50' bulk tranfer
    facility in HyperMIDI. It works with any type of transfer and will be successful
    provided that the in/out buffer of SoundObjectEditor is set to a sufficient value
    (approximately 120 000 bytes for a D-50 bulk transfer producing exactly 36 048 MIDI
    events).
### Send MIDI data from file...
This command allows you to send data to a MIDI device from a text file. It may be used,
    for instance, to initialize a MIDI device using its bulk transfer facility.
• Data is sent at the maximum rate allowed by the MIDI interface.
### Type from MIDI [toggle]
When "Type from MIDI" is active (special cursor), any key you hit on the MIDI keyboard
    types the corresponding note in the currently active window. Names of notes depend on
    the convention you select: English, French, Indian, key numbers.
• Pushing the "Hold" pedal displays a prolongation symbol '_'.
• In the same mode, program changes are recorded as script commands, and it is possible
    to enter automatically the arguments of the following "performance controls":
_chan(),_vel(),_volume(),_pan(),_mod(),_press(),_pitchbend(),_pancontrol(),_volumecontrol().
• Click on the control's name, move the corresponding MIDI control an hit any key on the
    computer to freeze the correct value.
• This parameter capture looks at preceding _pitchrange(), _pancontrol() and
    _volumecontrol() in order to check the proper controller and assess its range.
### Load time pattern...
When either grammar or data window is active, this allows you to create "time patterns".
• Play notes in sequence on the MIDI keyboard at the correct tempo.
• For a sequence of 'n' notes, BP2 will create 'n-1' time objects: t1,t2, etc., which will
    be assigned duration ratios.
### Time patterns
Sequences of time intervals characterized by precise ratios, to be used in "smooth time".
• These are processed like (codeless) "sound-objects". They are usually put together in
    the first field of a "polymetric expression".
• Use "Load time pattern" to create these patterns, or type them in the grammar or alphabet.
• Example:
    TIMEPATTERNS:
    t1= 1/1  t2 = 3/2   t3 = 4/3 
    t4  = 1/2
    -----------------------
• Time patterns always start with 't' followed with digits.  Expressions may contain an
    integer or an integer ratio.  An example of polymetric expression using these time
    patterns is: {t1 t3 t4, do5 re5 mi5 fa5 - la5}  (See project '-gr.tryTimePatterns')
### _chan(x) [Performance control]

### _value [Performance control]
_value(param,x) assigns numeric value 'x' to "Performance parameter" 'param'.
• The value may be an integer or floating-point relative number.
• In the present version only 256 '_value(…,x)' statements can be handled with
    different 'x' values.
• Related topics: "_fixed", "_step", "_cont", "Performance parameter".
### Performance parameter
Up to 256 parameters with arbitrary names may be handled by BP2 apart from the
    predefined ones: pitchbend, pressure, modulation, etc. which generate
    MIDI messages and Csound events.
• An arbitrary parameter is automatically created when refered to in a "_value", "_fixed",
    "_cont" or "_step" statement.
• These parameters have no effect on the MIDI output.  A parameter is used by a Csound
    instrument if its name is found as a "Parameter name" in the Csound instrument
    description.
    (See "Csound instruments" in the "Ouput" menu and click the "MORE…" button)
• If a sequence of sound-objects or simple notes is preceded with '_cont(param)',
    the parameter 'param' will be interpolated as explained in
    "Continuous performance control".  In this case, it advisable to use two
    indexes for passing the start and end values over to the instrument.
    (See "Start index" and "End index")
• A typical expression containing a variable parameter named 'blurb':
    _cont(blurb) _value(blurb, 154.2) A4 B4 C4 _value(blurb, -21) D4
• Related topics: "_fixed", "_step", "_cont", "_value", "Parameter name".
### _pitchstep [Performance control]
Indicates that pich should change stepwise between two specified values.
### _pitchcont [Performance control]
Indicates that pich should change continuously between two specified values.
• See "Continuous performance control"
### _press(x) [Performance control]
Controls channel pressure on current channel.
• Range of x is 0..127
• The argument may also be Kx.  See "variable arguments".
### _presstep [Performance control]
Indicates that channel pressure should change stepwise between two specified values.
### _presscont [Performance control]
Indicates that channel pressure should change continuously between two specified values.
• See "Continuous performance control"
### _switchon(i,c) [Performance control]
Sets controller i to 127 on channel c. For instance, if controller 64 is the hold
    pedal, this command will have the same effect as pushing the pedal.
• The range for 'i' is 64 to 95.
### _switchoff(i,c) [Performance control]
Sets controller i to 0 on channel c. For instance, if controller 64 is the hold pedal,
    this command will have the same effect as releasing the pedal.
• The range for 'i' is 64 to 95.
### _volumestep [Performance control]
Indicates that volume should change stepwise between two specified values.
### _volumecont [Performance control]
Indicates that volume should change continuously between two specified values.

### _staccato(x) [Performance control]
Indicates that durations will be decreased by x% to produce staccato effect.
### _articulstep [Performance control]
Indicates that articulation (legato-staccato) should change stepwise between two
specified values.
### _articulcont [Performance control]
Indicates that articulation (legato-staccato) should change continuously between two
specified values.
### _velfixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _velcont or _velstep.
### _modfixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _modcont or _modstep.
### _pitchfixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _pitchcont or _pitchstep.
### _pressfixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _presscont or _presstep.
### _volumefixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _volumecont or _volumestep.
### _articulfixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _articulcont or _articulstep.
### _panfixed [Performance control]
Cancels the effect of _pancont or _panstep.
### _pitchrange(x) [Current channel] [Performance control]
Sets the range of pitchbend control to ± x cents on the current channel. This value
    should reflect the range on the current 'patch' of the MIDI expander.
• For instance, _pitchrange(300) means that pitch modifications will be in the range of
    three semitones above and below the average value.
• Once _pitchrange(x) has been specified on a MIDI channel, subsequent _pitchbend(y)
    messages indicate pitch corrections in cents, with y varying between -x and +x.
    "_pitchrange(0)" [default value] indicates that subsequent _pitchbend(y) messages
    on the current MIDI channels take the actual MIDI value for y (range 0..16383).
### _transpose(x) [Tool]
Transposes notes 'x' semitones higher in the remaining part of the sequence.
• 'x' may also be negative or decimal (down to +/- 0.01).
• Transposition is clipped to the MIDI octave range.
• Transposition is also effective on "sound-objects" whose property "Accept transposition"
    is set to TRUE.
• Transpositions are cumulated over polymetric expressions.
    For instance,
        _transpose(-12) {_transpose(2) A3 _transpose(4) D4}
    will produce the same output as:
       _transpose(-10) A3 _transpose(-8) D4
• _transpose(Kx) is no longer licit.
### _transposecont [Tool]
Following "_transposecont", "_transpose(x)" values are interpolated.
• Try for instance:
    _transposecont _transpose(0) C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 C4 _transpose(12) C4
• "_transposecont" is cancelled by "_transposefixed".
• In the current version, "_transposecont" and "_transposestep" are equivalent.
### _transposestep [Tool]
See "_transposecont".
### _transposefixed [Tool]
Cancels the effect of "_transposecont" or "_transposestep".
### _pitchrate(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]
Sets the rate of continuous change of pitchbend to x samples per second.
### _modrate(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]
Sets the rate of continuous change of modulation to x samples per second.

Sets the rate of continuous change of panoramic controller to x samples per second.
### _volumecontrol(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]
Informs BP2 that MIDI controller x controls the volume (on the current channel).
• Default value is 7, in agreement with "General MIDI" specs.
### _pancontrol(x) [Current channel]  [Performance control]
informs BP2 that MIDI controller x controls the panoramic (on the current channel).
• Default value is 10, in agreement with "General MIDI" specs.
### _volume(x) [Performance control]
Controls volume on the current channel (range 0 to 127). The default controller is MIDI
    controller #7 and may be changed by _volumecontrol(). Default value is 90 (as per General
    MIDI specs).
• If button "Reset controllers" is checked on the "Settings" dialog, volumes on
    all channels are reset to default value once an item has been played.
• Range of x is 0..127
• The argument may also be Kx.  See "variable arguments".  In this case it may be
    controlled by a MIDI device during the performance.
### _pan(x) [Performance control]
Controls panoramic on the current channel (range 0 to 127). The default controller is
    MIDI controller #10 and may be changed by _pancontrol(). Default value is 64.
• If button "Reset controllers" is checked on the "Settings" dialog, panoramics on
    all channels are reset to default value once an item has been played.
• Range of x is 0..127
• The argument may also be Kx.  See "variable arguments".  In this case it may be
    controlled by a MIDI device during the performance.

    an external MIDI device are typed to the window.
### MIDI check output
• Play random sequences on the MIDI port to check the output.
• Select instruments on polytimbral synthesizers (including QuickTime Music).
### RESET (Keyboard window)
Delete all tokens attached to keys. (See "Type tokens")
### MIDI PANIC
This command does three things:
• It sends a "AllNotesOff" message to each of the 16 MIDI channels;
• It sends a "NoteOff" to each key of channel 1 and of every channel that has been assigned a
    MIDI instrument (see "MIDI orchestra");
• It clears the current buffer so that no more MIDI message is sent to the MIDI device.
    
• A good idea is to reset your MIDI device (synth, keyboard, etc.) by switching it off and on.
### Expand selection window «windowname»
You selected text in the current edit window that will be interpreted by BP2 as a
    "polymetric expression". The complete (expanded) polymetric expression will be shown
    if the syntax is correct and if terminal symbols belong to the current alphabet.
• This is also a script command.
### Tables…
Displays a window allowing the edition of tables used by Csound instruments.
### Play selection in window «windowname»
If symbols and syntax are correct, the selection in the current edit window will be
    played on the MIDI output. You may check "Show graphics" on the "Settings" dialog to
    see how "sound-objects" are set in time.
• This is also a script command.
### Ignore constraints

### Reset controllers [Settings dialog]
Resets switches, pitch benders, modulation, channel pressure, panoramic and volume
    on all channels once an item has been played. This option is recommended although it may
    be time consuming.
• Note that BP2 keeps track of the channels on which controllers
    have been changed, so normal reset will only occur on those channels. (Consequently,
    if a controller has been changed by another device than BP2, it may not be reset
    properly.)  However, general reset is forced when invoking "Produce items" if this
    option is checked.
• From version 2.7.4 onward, only those switches that have explicitly be changed by "_switchon"
    are reset.

    of text selection as a musical item;
• the expansion of the item as a "polymetric expression"
• the "time-setting" of the expanded expression.
### Type tokens [toggle]
Instead of typing the characters indicated on the computer's keyboard, when 
   "Type tokens" is on, key presses are mapped to tokens (strings of characters)
   as defined in a 'keyboard' file (-kb.filename).  Tokens are entered into
   the current edit window as you type, separated by spaces as necessary.
• To edit, save and load tokens, display the "Keyboard" window.
• This setting can be changed in the "Keyboard" window or from the 'Settings' menu.
• Can be changed with the script commands "Use tokens ON" and "Use tokens OFF".

See "Use tokens".
### OK
Tells BP2 that you want it to accept the changes made in the current window
    and then hides the window.
### New seed (Random sequence)
Creates an arbitrary new seed that will be used for random generation. This is the
    'randomize' procedure used by programmers. The new seed will be displayed and may
    be reused to produce exactly the same sequence (with exactly the same grammar).
• This reseeding can be automated if the "_randomize" procedure is placed on top of
    a grammar.
• Related topics: "_srand", "_randomize", "Randomize", "Reset random sequence",
    "Set random seed".
### Use buffer limit OFF
Ignore specified buffer limit: the "work string" may grow forever.
### Use buffer limit ON

### Rule arrows
<-> --> and <-- are the three derive modes in grammars.
--> means that the rule may be used in "production" only
<-- means that it is to be used in analysis (parsing) only
<-> means that the rule may be used in both modes.
    (This is the usual format for "true BP grammars")
### true BP grammars
These grammars can be used both in "production" and in analysis (parsing).
    See the reference manual. When compiling a grammar, BP2 checks whether it may be taken
    as a true BP grammar.
### GEN type of a Csound parameter
Indicates the Csound generator used with function tables describing variations of this
    parameter.  GEN07 (linear interpolation) is assumed by default.  GEN08 (cubic spline)
    is another option.
### General MIDI
An international standard aimed at making it easy to play MIDI files with predictable
    results on different synthesizers. Basic specifications are a mapping of
    128 typical instruments to 128 program numbers (numbered 1 to 128), and a mapping of
    key numbers to typical percussive sounds (to be played on channel 10).
• In BP2, General MIDI (and customized mappings) is defined as a glossary, namely
    "-gl.GeneralMIDI".  Information about General MIDI may be obtained from Tom White,
    RolandCorp, 7200 Dominion Circle, Los Angeles CA 90040, USA.  You may also contact

### Send dilation ratio to controller:
Create a MIDI message containing "dilation ratio" and send it to the specified
    controller before the first message of the object is sent. Some MIDI devices may
    use this information to modify the sound generation process accordingly.
• If 'alpha' is the dilation ratio (alpha = 1 means no change in the timing), then
    the value sent in this MIDI message is: 32 * log(alpha) + 64
    where 'log' is a decimal logarithm.

Never change channels of this object even if context [ _chan(x) ] demands it.
### Force to channel:
Force all channel messages of this object to specified channel.
### Accept transposition
If unchecked, object will ignore all "_transpose" controls.
### Accept articulation changes
If unchecked, object will ignore all "_legato" and "_staccato" controls.
### Accept volume changes
If unchecked, object will ignore all "_volume" controls.
### Accept panoramic changes
If unchecked, object will ignore all "_pan" controls.
### Accept key changes
If unchecked, object will ignore all "_keymap" and "_keyxpand" controls.
### Accept velocity changes
If unchecked, velocity in this sound-object cannot be modified.
### Enter and find
Enters text selection and looks for it in current window.
### Tempo markers
These are numbers preceded with slashes explicitly indicating the 'speed' of a sequence
    of sound-objects, i.e. the number of sound objects performed in one tick of
    the metronome.  In the beginning of a musical item, other numbers may indicate meter
    sections.  See "Section headers".
• Tempo markers are obsolete. Use "_tempo(x)" in replacement of "/x".
### mm = <metronome value>
This indicates the number of ticks per minute in the "Time base".
### Transpose input notes:
If checked, and if non zero value is specified, then all notes entered from the MIDI
    keyboard are transposed accordingly.  For instance, if the transposition value is
    -3 semitones, the C5 key will be transcribed as A4.
### INIT: <initialisation line>
Use this line on top of a grammar to define a process that should be activated (ONCE)
    before improvizing.  A typical example is the setting of a 'patch' on the synthesizer.
• The initialisation line itself is a single script instruction. There are two cases:
1) A "Play «any item»" instruction is executed when the first item has been produced and is
    ready to be performed; thus there is no delay between initialisation and the
    beginning of the performance.
2) Any other instruction is executed before producing the first item.  This allows a
    sufficient delay, for instance in the case of a patch change.
### Performance controls
To display the list of currently implemented performance controls, select
    "Pick tool or performance control" in the "Edit" menu.
• Each control is documented on-line.  These controls are used for
    adding expressiveness to the performance (e.g. _legato, _volume, etc.) or changing
    MIDI parameters (e.g. _pitchbend) that are not mapped to specific "sound-objects".

### Apple Events
These are used to handle communication between several applications running under
    MacOS on the same, or several interconnected machines.
    BP2 responds to local Apple Events (sent by the same computer) and to remote ones
    (sent by other computers over a local network).

    A test client application named "TryAppleEvents.fm" running under FileMaker Pro is
    supplied.

    In addition, scripts commands like "AE send" and "AE wait" make it possible to send
    (local) Apple Events or wait for events sent by other applications.

BP2 handles the following Apple Events:
• The four core Apple Events of class 'aevt':
   Open application (ID 'oapp');
   Open document (ID 'odoc');
   Print document (ID 'pdoc');
   Quit application (ID 'quit');
• Events of class 'Bel0', with no parameter, controlling BP2:
    ID 'beep' beeps BP2 (usefull for tests);
    ID 'impr' tells BP2 to improvize with the current grammar;
    ID 'dosc' tells BP2 to run the current script;
    ID 'quit' aborts current process;
    ID 'paus' interrupts the current process;
    ID 'cont' resumes the current process;
    ID 'fast' tells the inference engine and the interpreter that an item shall be
        played as soon as possible;
    ID 'more' tells the inference engine and the interpreter that the current item
        shall be played again;
    ID 'skip' tells the interpreter that the item being produced shall not be played.
• Events of class 'Bel0' sending a 'TEXT' parameter and expecting BP2 to do something with it:
    ID 'scri' loads the text as a BP2 script;
    ID 'gram' loads the text as a BP2 grammar;
    ID 'alph' loads the text as a BP2 alphabet;
    ID 'glos' loads the text as a BP2 glossary;
    ID 'inte' loads the text as a BP2 interactive file;
    ID 'data' loads the text as a BP2 data file;
    ID 'csin' loads the text as a BP2 "Csound instrument file";
    ID 'name' reads each line in text and tries to assign it to one of the current
        BP2 files (grammar,alphabet,data,glossary,interaction,time base,
        keyboard,sound-object prototypes,settings,script). Names may be separated by
        spaces or returns. Each name should start with a valid BP2 prefix.
    ID 'play' interprets the text as a musical item in BP2 syntax;
    ID 'scln' interprets the text as a single BP2 script line, with the
        advantage of not writing in the Script window;
    ID 'sett' loads the settings file specified in the text;
    ID 'conv' sets "note convention" to specified option: English, French,Indian or Keys.
        (These keywords are NOT case-sensitive.)

"AE wait"
### AE send fast class '«AEclass»' ID '«AEID»' to application '«signature»'
See "AE send normal". The difference lies in the high priority of the event. Use this
    version if the AE is needed for synchronisation.
### AE send normal class '«AEclass»' ID '«AEID»' to application '«signature»'
This script command sends an "Apple Event" with normal priority to an application
    running on the same machine.  (Remote Apple Events can be received, not sent,
    by this version.)
• For high priority, use "AE send fast".
• «AEclass» is the class of the Apple Event. For instance, most events processed by BP2
    have class 'Bel0'.
• «AEID» is the identification of the event in that class. See the documentation about the
    target application. See "Apple Events" for a complete documentation of events
    processed by BP2.
• «signature» is the signature (creator) of the target application. If not documented,
    it can be found by opening the application with ResEdit and selecting "Get Info..."
    in the "File" menu.  The signature of BP2 is also 'Bel0'.
### AE wait class '«AEclass»' ID '«AEID»'
This script command forces BP2 to wait for an Apple Event.  (Clicking the mouse also
    aborts the process.)
• «AEclass» is the class of the Apple Event. For instance, most events processed by BP2
    have class 'Bel0'.
• «AEID» is the identification of the event in that class. See the documentation about the
    target application. See "Apple Events" for a complete documentation of events
    processed by BP2.

### Time resolution:
The accuracy of the MIDI driver. Typically 10ms.
### Quantization:
Expected accuracy of the positions of "sound-objects".  This may be set to the maximum
    auditive tolerance on the perception of durations. 50ms is a good idea.
• A large quantization requires less memory space and computation time.
### beat(s) [max 40]
The number of beats of this tick cycle.
### beats
A "beat" of a sound-object is the time interval defined by its "Reference period".
### vel
Abbreviation for velocity.
### ms
Abbreviation for milliseconds.
### Speed ratio:
Each cycle of ticks may run at a speed different from the time base.
### MUTE
When checked, prevents tick cycle from being heard.
### _rest
See "Undetermined rests"
### Reset session time
Resets a clock counting seconds during BP2's operation. See "Tell session time".
### Tell session time
Tells the time elapsed since BP2 was started, or since "Reset session time" was last called.
• Related topic: "Reset session time".
• This is also a script command.
### TryAppleEvents.fm

### Set weights
Sets all rule weights in the grammar to a specified value.
### Learn weights
If the grammar is a "true BP grammar", it is possible to derive rule weights from a set of
    examples, i.e. a set of musical items that could have been produced by the grammar.
• The result is a grammar that produces musical items very close to the ones used for the
    learning process.
• Before learning weights it is advised to save the current ones. See "Save weights".
• Load the examples to the "Data" window and select them, then click "Learn weights".
• The weight of each rule will be incremented by the number of times it has been used during the
    parsing of the sample set.
• At the end of parsing the option is given to add infered weights to current weights, or replace
    current weights with infered weights. The first option is used when several sample sets are
    needed for learning weights.  The second option prompts confirmations: "Keep infered weights
    in current grammar?" and "Update grammar with new weights?".
• Related topics:
"Load weights"
"Set weights"

### Show weights
Displays the grammar with the current values of its rule weights. This is useful when the production
    of items changes rule weights.
### Load weights
Changes weights in a grammar according to values previously saved in a '-wg' file. In many cases
    a warning is issued saying that the grammar has been modified since its weights were saved,
    because the weight file keeps a record of compilation time. Be careful not to load weights
    obtained in a grammar with a different arrrangement of rules, otherwise BP2 may crash…

    the decisions taken so far to a decision file.

### Check variables
If a grammar is loaded and compiled, it lists the variables found by the compiler and
indicates:
• unreachable variables (that can't be generated by the grammar)
• undefined variables (that can't be rewritten by any rule in the grammar)
### Pre-roll
Delay between the first event (MIDI message or Csound event) of a "sound-object" and the
    beginning of its time-span interval.
• Pre-roll is null by default.
• A negative pre-roll amounts to a silence inserted before the first event of the
    sound-object. This silence may for instance be 'protected' thanks to property "Never cover".
• A positive pre-roll allows some events to fall before the on-setting time
    (beginning) of the sound-object. This may be useful if the sound-object contains an
    initialisation sequence that should not be part of its time-span interval.
• A positive pre-roll is also the proper way of compensating a mechanical delay in the
    device producing the sound-object. If for instance the event sequence in the sound-object
    starts with a NoteOn and the device takes 100ms to react, then setting the pre-roll
    to 100ms will displace all MIDI messages by 100ms to the past, so that their effects
    coincide with the desired timings.  Generally you will also set up a positive "post-roll"
    to compensate the delay in setting off events.
• Remember the formula:
    Sound-object duration
        = date of last event - date of first event - pre-roll + post-roll
• Related topics: "Post-roll", "Insert silence"
### Post-roll
Delay between the last event of a "sound-object" and the end of its time-span interval.
• Post-roll is null by default.
• A negative post-roll allows some events to fall beyond the off-setting time (end) of a
    sound-object. This may be useful if the sound-object contains a final sequence of events
    that should not be part of its time-span interval.
• A positive post-roll amounts to a silence appended after the last event of the
    sound-object. This silence may for instance be 'protected' thanks to property "Never cover".
• A positive post-roll is also the proper way of compensating a mechanical delay in setting-off
	the device producing the sound-object. If for instance the event sequence in the sound-object
    ends with a NoteOff and the device takes 50ms to react, then setting the post-roll
    to 50ms will append a 50ms silence after the sound-object to allow the device to finish its
    job. This is generally combined with a positive "pre-roll" compensating on-setting delays.
• Remember the formula:
    Sound-object duration
        = date of last event - date of first event - pre-roll + post-roll
• Related topics: "Pre-roll", "Append silence"
### Cyclic sound-objects
Any sound-object may contain a periodical part starting at an arbitrary point of its
    time-span interval (see "Periodical after").
• BP2 handles two typical cases:
    1) The sequence of events in the periodical part must be sent again
       to the sound device when that part is repeated.  This happens for instance
       with sound-objects produced by a MIDI synthesizer.
    2) Cyclic properties are defined but there is no need to repeat the sequence in
       the periodical part.  This happens for instance with sound-objects produced
       by a MIDI sampler: the sampler expects BP2 to trigger the sample with a
       NoteOn and it takes care of repetitions until a NoteOff is received.
  In '-mi.abc1', for instance, 'cycle1' illustrates case 1 and 'cycle2' case 2.
• Property "Discard NoteOff's except in last period" is useful with objects in case 2.
    It prevents the sample from setting off as soon as the first cycle is completed.
    This property is generally combined with "Don't strike again NoteOn's".
• Property "Force integer number of periods" modifies durations making sure that the
    last repetition of the cyclic part is complete.
• It is a good idea to place the object's pivot at the beginning of the periodical
    part.  See "Set pivot".
• If a cyclic sound-object has a negative "post-roll", events falling beyond its off-setting
	time are ignored.
• Beware when setting the startpoint of the periodical part: the balance between
    NoteOn's and NoteOff's should be equal in the periodical part.
    BP2 compensates some balance problems by avoiding two successive NoteOn's on the
    same key and channel (see "Strike NoteOn's according to default") and appending
    extra NoteOff's after the item when necessary, but an improper balance may result
    in unwanted auditive results.
• Related topics: "OK Rescale", "Never rescale", "Dilation ratio range",
    "Expand at will", "Compress at will", "Periodical after"
### Periodical after
If this option is checked then the sound-object contains a periodical part starting
	at a defined point of its time-span interval.  The value (in milliseconds or
	as a percentage of the duration) is the duration of the initial non-cyclic part.
• If the sound-object does not have the "Expand at will" property it makes no difference
	to specify the initial non-cyclic part in milliseconds or as a percentage of the duration.
• The last events of a cyclic object may be discarded if its "post-roll" is set to a
    negative value.
• Related topic: "Cyclic sound-objects".
### No period
This sound-object has no periodical part.  This is a default setting.
• Related topic: "Cyclic sound-objects". 
### Force integer number of periods
This property fixes acceptable durations so that the last repetition of the periodical
	part is complete.
• The property is only needed for sound-objects that do not have the "Expand at will"
    property, or that have specified limits for the "Dilation ratio range". However, it
    does not harm to set it with resizable sound-objects.
• Related topic: "Cyclic sound-objects".
### Discard NoteOff's except in last period
This property is used with cyclic sound-objects, notably the ones representing samples
    on a MIDI sampler.  When the object (or part of it) is repeated, then the NoteOff
    encountered at the end of the first cycle may set off the sample, so that the sample
    won't be heard during the following cycles.
• If the property is checked, any NoteOff will be discarded unless it appears in the
    last cycle.
• With this property it is recommended to check "Don't strike again NoteOn's", so that
    no unwanted NoteOff's are produced when NoteOn's are found in the repeated cycle.
• Related topic: "Cyclic sound-objects".
### Strike again NoteOn's
If a NoteOn must be sent while the same key of the same channel is already active
    (because a NoteOn has already been sent) then BP2 will first send a NoteOff to
    deactivate the key.
This is the default mode in BP2 (see "Strike NoteOn's according to default").
• Some MIDI sound devices may hang if two successive NoteOn's are sent to the same
    key and the same channel.  BP2 keeps track of key on/off status to make sure this
    never happens.
• Related topic: "Don't strike again NoteOn's"
### Don't strike again NoteOn's
If a NoteOn must be sent while the same key of the same channel is already active
    (because a NoteOn has already been sent) then BP2 will ignore it.
• This is not BP2's default mode: see "Strike NoteOn's according to default"
• Related topics: "Strike again NoteOn's", "Discard NoteOff's except in last period"
### Strike NoteOn's according to default
If a NoteOn must be sent while the same key of the same channel is already active
    (because a NoteOn has already been sent) then BP2 will behave as per its default
    setting.
• BP2's default setting is the behaviour defined as "Strike again NoteOn's".
• Related topic: "Don't strike again NoteOn's"
### % of duration
The specified value is a percentage of the sound-object's duration, so the actual
    value will vary according to its "dilation ratio".
### Capture…
• If a "sound-object prototype" is being displayed:
    Copies MIDI codes of this "sound-object prototype" to a MIDI stream
    that may later be pasted to another (or the same) prototype.
• If the "Time base" dialog is being displayed:
    Capture the current tick cycle and paste it later to a "sound-object prototype".
• Related topic: "Paste MIDI stream"
### Capture selection as…
Takes the text selection in the current edit window, tries to interpret it as a musical
    item, using the current alphabet of "terminal symbols", plays it to the MIDI
    output and capture the MIDI codes so a MIDI stream that may later be pasted to
    a "sound-object prototype".
• Related topic: "Paste MIDI stream"
### Paste MIDI stream
Takes the currently captured MIDI stream (see "Capture selection as…" and "Capture…")
    and pastes it to the currently displayed "sound-object prototype.
There are several options:
• Option "Delete and replace"
    erases the MIDI sequence of the sound-object prototype and replaces it with the
    MIDI stream.
• Option "Insert at insert point"
    inserts the MIDI stream at the insert point marked by a vertical red line on the
    sound-object prototype.
• Option "Replace from insert point"
    replaces part of the MIDI sequence of the sound-object prototype, starting at the
    insert point marked by a vertical red line, with the MIDI stream.
• Option "Merge from insert point"
    merges MIDI messages in the MIDI stream with the ones contained in the sound-object
    prototype, starting at the insert point marked by a vertical red line.
• Option "Insert before"
    inserts the MIDI stream before the MIDI sequence of the sound-object prototype.
• Option "Append"
    appends the MIDI stream after the MIDI sequence of the sound-object prototype.
### Write Csound scores
When checked, musical items that BP2 produces are also written as Csound scores.
    You may control how score files are created from the "File save preferences" window.
• This setting is also accessible from the 'Devices' menu as "Csound scores".
• May be toggled with the script commands: "Csound score ON" and "Csound score OFF".
• Related topics: "Csound format", "Csound implementation"
### Csound implementation
• Csound is a 100% software environment for the design and transformation of digitized
    sounds.  It runs on most platforms, including MacOS 9 & X, Linux, and Windows.
    Csound is "free software" (open source) distributed under the GNU LGPL license.
• To download Csound, connect to http://csound.sourceforge.net/
• BP2 produces Csound scores in the same way it produces MIDI files or real-time MIDI:
    the "Csound scores" option may be selected in the "Output" menu and is saved with 
    the options of the current project or data.
• Once the option has been selected you may produce a Csound score for each musical item
    produced by a grammar or played from its text representation (a BP2 "score").  Items
    may be played on real-time MIDI, saved to Csound scores, to MIDI files, or any
    combination of these.
• If the musical item contains simple notes or sound-objects defined as streams of MIDI
    messages, BP2 converts the stream to a sequence of Csound events, using the
    specifications of Csound instruments defined in a "Csound instrument file".  This file
    can be created and edited in the "Csound instruments" dialog accessible from the
    "Devices" menu.  Csound instrument specifications should contain data that is
    consistent with the "orchestra" file that will be invoked by Csound when compiling
    the score produced by BP2.
• If no "Csound instrument file" is loaded, BP2 uses a default instrument which has only
    the start/end timing arguments and accepts pitch in the "octave point pitch-class"
    representation.  It is more clever to design a Cound orchestra with instruments
    accepting parameters like pitchbend, pressure, modulation etc., which BP2 handles
    in a smart way, using a "vector" representation of continuous parameter changes.
• Sound-object protoypes may also contain Csound scores.  In this case, BP2 creates a
    score of the musical item arranging these individual scores after changing their
    timings and arguments according to the musical item and specifications of Csound
    instruments.  BP2 may therefore produce Csound scores using only Csound events and
    Csound instrument specifications as an input, thereby bypassing current limitations
    of MIDI.
• The mapping between Csound argument values (the ones found in the Csound score) and
    MIDI / BP2 ranges is defined automatically once the user has supplied three typical
    pairs of values.  BP2 performs linear or quadratic interpolation, plus logarithmic
    mapping if requested to do so.
• In addition, BP2 handles "Performance parameters" with arbitrary names the values
    of which may be taken as arguments by Csound instruments.
• Related topic: "Csound format"
### Devices [menu]
Contains menu commands for turning on or off BP2's various output options ("MIDI",
"MIDI files", and "Csound scores"), choosing between multiple MIDI drivers when
available, and for configuring MIDI and Csound output options.
### Pitch argument:
Put here the index of the argument controlling pitch in this Csound instrument.
### Check orchestra file
This feature not yet implemented.  A future version of BP2 will check the consistency
    of information contained in this dialog with the one contained in the Csound
    orchestra file it describes.
### Copy from…
Copy instrument specifications from another instrument.
### log
If checked, it means that the 3 values shown on the left are on a logarithmic scale.
• If 'log' is checked on both lines of the mapping, it has no effect.
### Assign as default to channel:
If a number in range 1..16 is indicated here, it means that the corresponding MIDI
    channel is assigned by default to this Csound instrument.
• This feature facilitates the mapping to Csound of musical items that contain
    MIDI channel information instead of Csound instrument assignments.
### Number of arguments:
This box contains the maximum number of arguments used by this Csound instrument.
• Csound arguments that are not explicitly mapped to MIDI or BP2 parameters are
    written as zero values.
### octave point pitch-class
In this representation, pitch is represented as a decimal number in which the integer
    part is the octave number and the decimal part is the pitch class.
• For example, the following mapping is used:
C4 = 8.00   D4 = 8.02   E4 = 8.04   F4 = 8.05   G4 = 8.07 
A4 = 8.09   B4 = 8.11
### octave point decimal
In this representation, pitch is represented as a decimal number in which the integer
    part is the octave number and the decimal part is the fraction of the octave.
• For example, the following mapping is used:
C4 = 8.00   D4 = 8.17   E4 = 8.33   F4 = 8.42   G4 = 8.58 
A4 = 8.75   B4 = 8.92
### cps (Hz)
In this representation, pitch is represented in cycles per second (Hertz).
• For example, the following mapping is used:
C5 = 523.25   D5 = 587.33   E5 = 659.26   F5 = 698.46   G5 = 783.99
A5 =  880.00  B5 = 987.77
• These values depend on the settings of the diapason in the "Tuning dialog".
### Pitchbend arguments:
Boxes contain the indexes of arguments sending pitchbend information to this
    Csound instrument.
• The left box is the argument containing the pitchbend value at the start date of
    any event related to this instrument.
• The middle box (optional) is the argument containing the pitchbend value at the clip
    date of any event related to this instrument.
• The rightmost box (optional) is the argument which may refer to a function table
    for continuous variations.
• If this instrument does not use pitchbend leave boxes empty.
### Pitchbender range (cents) +/-
This box contains the range (in cents) of the pitchbend used in MIDI format, which
    may have been specified in the data or grammar with "_pitchrange(x)".
• This information may be needed by BP2 for a correct remapping of pitchbend values
    from MIDI to Csound.
### Volume arguments:
Boxes contain the indexes of arguments sending volume information to this
    Csound instrument.
• The left box is the argument containing the volume value at the start date of
    any event related to this instrument.
• The middle box (optional) is the argument containing the volume value at the clip
    date of any event related to this instrument.
• The rightmost box (optional) is the argument which may refer to a function table
    for continuous variations.
• If this instrument does not use volume leave boxes empty.
### Pressure arguments:
Boxes contain the indexes of arguments sending channel pressure information to this
    Csound instrument.
• The left box is the argument containing the pressure value at the start date of
    any event related to this instrument.
• The middle box (optional) is the argument containing the pressure value at the clip
    date of any event related to this instrument.
• The rightmost box (optional) is the argument which may refer to a function table
    for continuous variations.
• If this instrument does not use pressure leave boxes empty.
### Modulation arguments:
Boxes contain the indexes of arguments sending modulation information to this
    Csound instrument.
• The left box is the argument containing the modulation value at the start date of
    any event related to this instrument.
• The middle box (optional) is the argument containing the modulation value at the clip
    date of any event related to this instrument.
• The rightmost box (optional) is the argument which may refer to a function table
    for continuous variations.
• If this instrument does not use modulation leave boxes empty.
### Panoramic arguments:
Boxes contain the indexes of arguments sending panoramic information to this
    Csound instrument.
• The left box is the argument containing the panoramic value at the start date of
    any event related to this instrument.
• The middle box (optional) is the argument containing the panoramic value at the clip
    date of any event related to this instrument.
• The rightmost box (optional) is the argument which may refer to a function table
    for continuous variations.
• If this instrument does not use panoramic leave boxes empty.
### Attack velocity argument:
This box contains the index of the argument of this Csound instrument which should
    contain the NoteOn velocity information.
• Leave the box empty if this instrument does not need the information.
### Release velocity argument:
This box contains the index of the argument of this Csound instrument which should
    contain the NoteOff velocity information.
• Leave the box empty if this instrument does not need the information.
### Dilation ratio argument:
This box contains the index of the argument of this Csound instrument which should
    contain the "dilation ratio" information.
• Leave the box empty if this instrument does not need the information.
### Csound instruments
This dialog contains a description of arguments used by an instrument defined in a
    Csound orchestra file.
• Type command-? and click any button or static text to get the information.
• Clicking the "MORE…" button displays a few additional arguments that can be mapped to
    arbitrary "Performance parameters".
• Related topic: "Csound implementation", "Csound instrument file".
### Parameter name
This field is accessed by clicking "MORE…" in the "Csound instruments" dialog.
The name of this parameter should match the one of a "Performance parameter" used in
    the data or grammar, otherwise the argument(s) listed under this name will
    always remain 0.
• Related topics: "_step", "_cont", "_value", "Performance parameter".
### Start argument
This is the index of the argument used in a Csound event to pass on the value of this
    parameter, or the initial value in case it varies continuously.
    (See "Continuous performance control")
• Related topics: "Parameter name", "End argument", "Table argument"
### End argument
This is the index of the argument used in a Csound event to pass on the final value of
	this parameter in case it varies continuously.
    (See "Continuous performance control")
• The box may remain empty if the parameter never varies continuously or the Csound
    instrument is not designed for continuous variation of this parameter.
• Related topics: "Parameter name", "Start argument", "Table argument"
### Table argument
This is the index of the argument used in a Csound event to pass on the index of
	a function table when the parameter varies continuously.
    (See "Continuous performance control")
• The box may remain empty if the parameter never varies continuously or the Csound
    instrument is not designed for continuous variation of this parameter.
• Related topics: "Parameter name", "Start argument", "End argument"
### Argument boxes
• The left box contains the index of the Csound instrument argument taking the initial
    value of this control.
• The middle box is only used for "continuous performance control".  It contains the
    index of the argument taking the final value of this control.
• The rightmost box contains the index of the argument taking the reference of the
    function table that BP2 creates for defining complex parameter variations.
    (See "Continuous performance control")
### Continuous performance control
• A few MIDI parameters such as pitchbend, modulation, volume, channel pressure and
    panoramic may be controlled continuously at a given sampling rate.  For example,
    a portamento may be produced by the following BP2 score:
        _pitchcont _pitchrate(20) _pitchbend(6000) A4 B4 _pitchbend(9000)
    in which BP2 will insert 20 pitchbend messages per second.
• Similarly, arbitrary parameters may be handled with effect only on the Csound
   output.  (See "Performance parameter").  For instance,
       _cont(blurb) _value(blurb,154.2) A4 B4 _value(blurb,-21) C4
• The default sampling rate is 50 messages per second.
• Csound events do not allow the insertion of real-time messages. Therefore it is
    necessary to supply the start and end values of the argument which will be
    interpolated by the procedure associated with the Csound instrument.  For instance,
    let the start value of pitchbend be sent as argument 5 and the end value as
    argument 6.  The score produced by BP2 using the preceding item reads:
        i1 0 1 8.09 6000 7500
        i1 1 1 8.11 7500 9000
   ("8.09" and "8.11" are the respective pitch values of A4 and B4.)
• Another option with Csound is to allow BP2 to create function tables to control
    the values.  An argument of the instrument should be reserved to passing on the
    table reference.
• Related topic: "Step performance control"
### Step performance control
• By default, all MIDI controls are modified only when explicit values are assigned
    to them by the BP2 score.  For instance, the following score assigns different
    modulation values to notes B4, C5 and D5:
        _modstep A4 _mod(2000) B4 C5 _mod(9000) D5
    Replacing "_modstep" (which is optional here) with "_modcont" would
    cause continuous changes of modulation at the rate of 50 messages per second.
• In this example it is advisable to check "Reset controllers" since the final value
    (9000) is not the same as the initial one (0).

### Store all items to same file
If checked, all musical items are stored to the same MIDI or Csound score file.
### Change name
Click this button to close the current MIDI or Csound score file and create a new one.
### MIDI file format
BP2 supports three MIDI file formats: types 0, 1 and 2.  Here are tips for choosing
    an output format:
•	If the file will contain a single musical item, or a sequence of items produced by a
    grammar in the "Improvize" mode, any format is OK.  Keep in mind, however, that
    format 2 may be rejected by single-track MIDI programs.
•	In the current version, BP2 saves each item to a single track. Types 0 and 1 may
    therefore be considered equivalent.
•	If the file will contain several independent musical items (each of which might
    have a different tempo or time signature), then type 2 must be used.
• BP2 imports files type 0, 1 or 2.  With format 1 it superimposes the tracks even if
    they have different time signatures.  With format 2, however, an error message
    will be displayed if the file contains several items.
### Prompt for changing file name
If checked, a new MIDI or Csound score file may be optionaly created for each
    musical item.
### Save each item to a new file
If checked, a new MIDI or Csound score file is created for each musical item.
### Write item immediately
If checked, musical items are immediately written as MIDI files and/or Csound scores.
### Write item after playing on MIDI
If checked, musical items are first played on MIDI and then optionaly written as
    MIDI files and/or Csound scores.
### Trace Csound
If checked, displays Csound scores in the "Trace" window.
### Convert to Csound

If checked, values of this parameter are combined additively.
• The formula is the following:
    If 'p0' is the parameter value found in the Csound score of a "sound-object", and 'x'
        the assigned value, the parameter value in the resulting score will be: 
    p1 = p0 + x - default
    ('default' is specified in the field "Default value".)
• Related topics: "MULTval", "Default value"
### MULTval
If checked, values of this parameter are combined multiplicatively.
• The formula is the following:
    If 'p0' is the parameter value found in the Csound score of a "sound-object", and 'x'
        the assigned value, the parameter value in the resulting score will be: 
    p1 = p0 * (x / default)
    ('default' is specified in the field "Default value".)
• Related topics: "ADDval", "Default value"
### Default value

### Allow randomize
• When this button is unchecked, BP2 does not reset the random sequence before producing items.
    Therefore, the same sequence of items might be produced again in the same context.
• When this button is checked, BP2 resets the random sequence before producing items, if allowed
    to do so.  Identical sequences are unlikely to occur.
### Opcode OMS
• When checked, MIDI input/output is conveyed via Opcode Open Music System.
    This solution is strongly recommended for MacOS 9 users of BP2.  On MacOS X,
    "CoreMIDI" is used instead.  OMS can be installed free on all Macs.
    Dowload from <http://www.opcode.com> or <ftp://ftp.opcode.com/pub/oms/mac>
    OMS also makes it possible to get loudspeaker output via QuickTime Music: select "OMS input-output"
      in the 'Devices' menu.
• When unchecked, MIDI input/output is conveyed via the in-built MIDI driver.
	In this case, the proper port ('Printer' or 'Modem') must be selected in the 'Devices' menu.
    This may not work with some Macs unless either EtherTalk or IRtalk is active.
    See "Why don't I hear any sound?" for details.

### Serial music with BP2
• Version 2.8.1 of BP2 introduced a few tools facilitating the design of musical structures
    following principles of serial music. However, these tools are applied to structures
    that may be more complex than simple sequences of sound-objects: "polymetric expressions",
    polyrhythmic phrases using the "period notation", tree structures constructed with
    "variables" in a grammar, metastructures containing "wild cards", etc.
• The current serial tools are:
    "_retro", "_rndseq", "_rotate", "_ordseq", "_keymap", "_keyxpand".
### _retro [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
This "tool" reverts the order of "sound-objects", "variables", "wild cards" and "time patterns"
    in the remaining part of a sequence.
• Examples
    a b _retro c d e              will become   a b e d c
    a b _retro {c d e,f g}        will become   a b {e d c,g f}      ["polymetric expression"]
    a b _retro {t1 t2 t3,f g}     will become   a b {t3 t2 t1,g f}   ["time patterns"]
    _retro {a b c • d e • f g}    will become   {g f • e d • c b a}  ["period notation"]
    a b _retro c d e _retro f g   will become   a b f g e d c        ["_retro" cancels itself]
• Check the preceding examples in ‘-gr.trySerial’
• Related topics: "_rndseq", "_ordseq", "_rotate".
### _rndseq [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
This "tool" shuffles the order of "sound-objects", "variables", "wild cards" and "time patterns"
    in the remaining part of a sequence.
• Don't confuse with "_randomize" which reseeds the random number generator.
• Examples [each example actually produces several combinations]
    a b _rndseq c d e              could become   a b c e d
    a b _rndseq {c d e,f g}        could become   a b {d e c,g f}      ["polymetric expression"]
    a b _rndseq {t1 t2 t3,f g}     could become   a b {t3 t1 t2,g f}   ["time patterns"]
    _rndseq {a b c • d e • f g}    could become   {b d f • c g • e a}  ["period notation"]
• Check the preceding examples in ‘-gr.trySerial’
• Related topics: "_retro", "_ordseq", "_rotate", "_srand", "_randomize".
### _rotate(x) [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
Rotates a sequence of "sound-objects" or "simple notes" (left shift of 'x' units).
• For instance,
    _rotate(3) A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4  yields  D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 B4 C4
• Rotation is applied recursively and cumulated additively on polymetric structures.
    (See '-gr.tryRotate' for a typical example)
• Range of x is -128..127
• The argument may also be Kx.  See "variable arguments".  In this case it may be
    controlled by a MIDI device during the performance.
### _ordseq [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
This "tool" prevents the remaining part of a sequence from being modified by "_rndseq",
    "_rotate" or "_retro".
• Related topics: "_rndseq", "_retro", "_rotate"
### _keymap(p1,q1,p2,q2) [Performance control]
A performance control for "serial music".
In the following sequence, this "performance control" modifies pitches in range (p1,p2)
    according to a linear mapping in which q1 is the image of p1 and q2 the image of p2.
• The tool makes changes on "simple notes" and on "sound-objects" in which the property
    "Accept key changes" has been set to true.
• Unlike "_keyxpand", changes do not occur during the production of a "grammar",
    but at "performance time".
• p1,q1,p2,q2 may be written as integers (key numbers) in range 0..127, or "simple notes"
    using the current "note convention", e.g.: _keymap(C3,G2,D6,F6).
• See '-gr.tryKeyMap' for typical examples.
• Related topic: "_keyxpand"
### _keyxpand(p,x) [Tool]
A tool for "serial music".
• In the following sequence, this "tool" multiplies by x melodic intervals relative to the
    centre note p. For instance,
    _keyxpand(C4,-2) B3 C4 D4 E4   yields  D4 C4 G#3 E3.
• Unlike "_keymap", this tool changes "simple notes" during the production of a "grammar".
• Just like "_retro", "_rndseq" and "_rotate", _keyxpand is applied recursively to the
    fields of a polymetric expression.  Values are cumulated multiplicatively if the centre
    note is the same. For instance,
    _keyxpand(C4,-2) B3 C4 {_keyxpand(C4,-1) D4 E4}  yields  D4 C4 {E4 G#3},
    i.e. the same as  _keyxpand(C4,-2) B3 C4 _keyxpand(C4,2) {D4 E4}.
• _keyxpand also makes changes on "simple notes" and on "sound-objects" in which the property
    "Accept key changes" has been set to true.
• See '-gr.tryKeyXpand' for typical examples.
• Related topic: "_keymap"
### _tempo(x) [Tool]
Multiplies the tempo by 'x'
• The argument may be a floating-point number or an integer ratio.
    Thus, _tempo(4/3) and _tempo(0.35) are valid expressions.
• In "polymetric expressions" tempo values are multiplied.
    For instance, in
        A4 B4 _tempo(2) C5 D5 {_tempo(1.5) E5 F5}
    "E5 F5" is performed at tempo 3 = 1.5 * 2.
• The above example shows that speed change is relative.
    Thus, '_tempo(2)' is not the strict equivalent of '/2' (the obsolete "tempo marker"
    notation) although it should replace it in most cases. "Tempo markers" are kept only
    for compatibility with old BP2 projects.
### Variable arguments
Some "performance controls", "tools", and rule weights in a grammar, can be given arguments
    notated K1, K2, ... Kx.
• These variables may be assigned fixed values (Kx = n) that are used in the grammar.
• In some cases, Kx can be set by an external MIDI device during the performance.
    (See "Interactive mode").
### MIDI fade-out
• If set to a value 'x' greater than zero, fade-out will append silences of duration 'x' after
    each track of a MIDI file, during which volume decreases stepwise on all channels.
    This compensates for the harshness of terminating the playback of MIDI files.
• Note that this fade-out is performed during a silence and does not affect notes played
    during the performance.  Use "_volume" and "_volumecont" to change volume during
    the performance.
### Transliterate text file…
Using the current grammar, BP2 will attempt to change codes in a text file (without actually
    displaying it.
• The text file may represent a database, in which case fields are separated with tabs and records
    are separated with line feeds.
• BP2 will offer options to take any start field, process it with "subgrammars" in a specified
    range, and save it to the same or another field.  In this process, new fields may also
    be created.
• Subgrammars are generally of "POSLONG" type.  The left argument of each rule in the
    first subgrammar contains strings of "terminal symbols" representing the ASCII codes found in
    the target text.  For instance, "f139" represents ASCII code 139.
    The right argument of each rule in the last subgrammar contains strings of "terminal symbols"
    representing ASCII codes to be used in the transliterated text.
• Related topic: "Make grammar from table"
### Make grammar from table...
A grammar may be designed in a table, e.g. an Excel file, and saved as 'tabulated text'.
BP2 reads the table and creates a "subgrammar" of a specified type, using a specified column
    for left arguments and another one for right arguments.
• Each line of the table contains a single rule.
• Columns are selected at the time the table is read and converted.  The same table may therefore
    yield different grammars, depending on which pair of columns has been selected.
    Columns are labelled 'A' to 'Z'.  (Maximum 26 columns in this version...)
• The first and last line to be used in the table may be specified.  By default the entire table is
    considered.
• There are several options for data format:
    1) ASCII machine code
        BP2 will read the actual sequence of ASCII codes in the cell and create terminal symbols
        starting with the specified character and indicating the actual code.  For example, if
        the start character is 'f' an ASCII code 78 will yield 'f78'.
    2) text
        BP2 will read the entire cell as a text string representing the actual rule's left or
        right argument.
    3) numeric
        BP2 expects a string of integer numbers separated with spaces or punctuation signs.
        For instance, a cell containing "128+45+7" will yield a rule argument "f128 f45 f7" if
        'f' is the selected starting character.

### Open Audio MIDI Setup
Launches the 'Audio MIDI Setup' utility application that comes with MacOS X.  Using this
    application, you can configure the hardware devices in your MIDI studio and create virtual
    MIDI "buses" for inter-application communication of MIDI messages.  This menu command is
    available when the CoreMIDI driver is active (on OS X).
### CoreMIDI settings...
Opens a window where you can configure Bol Processor's CoreMIDI "driver" on OS X.  In this
    window, you can select input sources and ouput destinations for MIDI messages, save and load
    "MIDI driver settings" files, and access other MIDI-related configuration options.
• Selecting MIDI sources/destinations:
    Two lists are available in this window: one for input sources and the other for output
  destinations.  Each item in a list represents a different device or program that you can
  receive MIDI messages from or send MIDI messages to in real-time.  The available sources and
  destinations are automatically updated whenever MacOS X tells BP2 that your MIDI configuration
  has changed.
    You select a source or a destination to connect to by clicking on its name and you can select
  multiple sources and destinations by Command-clicking or Shift-clicking on them.  BP2 will
  listen to all selected inputs simultaneously and currently all MIDI output generated by BP2
  will be copied to each of the selected output destinations.  (We are planning to implement
  selective routing of output in the future).
• Auto-selection of MIDI sources/destinations:
    To ensure that first-time users can easily get MIDI working with BP2, we have implemented a
  feature where an input source and output destination are automatically selected under some
  conditions.  When BP2 is launched, it will connect to the first source and first destination
  that it finds if any are available at that time.  Also, if a new MIDI source becomes available
  and there were previously NO sources in BP2's list, then BP2 will connect to it.  The same is
  true for MIDI destinations.  We hope that this will allow users with simple setups to make
  music without having to discover the CoreMIDI settings window and without causing any annoyance
  to experienced users with more complex needs.  NOTE:  Any connections automatically made at
  launch will be overridden if a "-md.startup" file exists in your preferences folder.  BP2
  will also not auto-connect after launch time if this file lists at least one source and one
  destination, even if those are not currently "online".
• Offline MIDI sources/destinations:
    Sometimes, existing MIDI sources and destinations can become unavailable while BP2 is
  running due to quitting another MIDI program or changing one's studio configuration.  BP2's
  CoreMIDI interface keeps track of every MIDI input and output that it has seen since it was
  launched and it marks any that become unavailable with "offline" after their names in the
  CoreMIDI Settings window.  You can still select these sources and destinations but they will
  of course not do anything until they become available again.  When they do, BP2 will reconnect
  to them for you.  You may also see "offline" sources and destinations after loading a
  "MIDI driver settings" file that references ones that are not currently available.
• This window contains three buttons for saving and restoring its configuration.  The 'Load' and
  "Save As..." buttons allow you to choose files to load MIDI settings from or save them to.
  With BP2 for MacOS X, these settings are now saved in a new file type called a
  "MIDI driver settings" file which has either a prefix of '-md' or an extension of '.bpmd'.
  The names of these files will be entered at the top of the grammar and data windows, similarly
  to the general settings files, so that BP2 can reload your settings with a project.
• The "Save Startup..." button will save BP2's current CoreMIDI settings to a special file
  in your user preferences folder named "-md.startup".  This file is loaded automatically at
  application launch time.

### Save Startup... [CoreMIDI Settings window]
Saves BP2's current CoreMIDI settings to a special file named "-md.startup".  This file is 
    automatically loaded when Bol Processor is launched.
• See "-md.startup" for more information.
### -md.startup
This "MIDI driver settings" file is automatically loaded if it exists when Bol Processor is
    launched.  On MacOS X, it is stored inside of your user folder in the 'Bol Processor'
    subfolder of the 'Preferences' folder inside of your 'Library' folder.  If this file does not
    exist BP2 will look for a file with the same name inside of the Bol Processor application
    package. On MacOS 9, MIDI settings are currently stored in the general settings files and the
    configuration in "-se.startup" is used when BP2 is launched.
NOTE:  BP2 will not find this file if you rename it or move it.  It cannot be named 
    'startup.bpmd' either; it must be '-md.startup'. 
### MIDI driver settings
Starting with Bol Processor 2.9.6, a new file type for storing MIDI settings exists.  These
    files have either a recommended prefix of '-md' or an extension of '.bpmd'.  The current
    implementation only uses this file type for CoreMIDI settings on MacOS X, but in the
    future, other MIDI drivers will use it as well.  A special file named "-md.startup" is
    automatically loaded when BP2 is launched if it exists.
