BOL PROCESSOR SOURCE CODE READ ME
=================================

Bol Processor 3 (BP3) is a program for music composition and improvisation
with real-time MIDI, MIDI file, and Csound output.  It produces music from a
set of rules (a compositional grammar) or from text scores typed or captured
from a MIDI instrument.

BP3 compiles and runs in the MacOS, Linux and Windows environments.

If you want to get started understanding the source code, look in the
"docs-developer" directory; particularly the files "BP2-info.txt" and
"BP2-history.txt".

If you need to create your own project file for a different version of
Xcode, CodeWarrior, or a different IDE, just add all of the files in
source/BP3 to an appropriate project template. The other directories are
not needed.

code or if you have any other questions.
